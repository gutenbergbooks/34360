<br>

<p class="normal"><i>The action takes place at a small pavilion situated in the
park
belonging to an old castle</i>.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>STREAKS OF LIGHT</h2>
<br>
<p class="normal"><i>An octagonal pavilion of the Rococo period, the three front
walls of
which are cut off by the proscenium. Ceiling and walls are cracked and
spotted by rain, and bear the marks of long disuse. At the back, in the
centre, a large doorway. The glass door is thrown wide open; the
shutters behind are closed. On the right and left, in the oblique walls
of the room, are windows, the shutters of which are also closed.
Through the blinds at the door and the right window, sunbeams in
streaks of light penetrate the semi-darkness of the room.</i></p>

<p class="normal"><i>On the left, in the foreground, a Louis Sixteenth sofa with
table and
gilded chairs to match. On the wall above, an old mirror. Near the
sofa, a tapestried doorway. A chandelier wrapped in a dusty gauze
covering is suspended from the ceiling. A four-post bed with hangings
of light net takes up the right side of the stage. In the foreground,
in front of the bed, a table with plates, glasses, wine-decanters, and
provisions on it. A coffee percolator stands under the table. In the
middle of the stage, a little to the right, a chaise-longue. At the
head of it, a small table. Between the large door and the windows,
dusty marble busts on dilapidated pedestals. Above them, on the walls,
a collection of various sorts of weapons. The Oriental rugs which are
thrown about the floor and over the chaise-longue contrast strangely
with the faded splendour of the past.</i></p>

<p class="normal"><i>The whole room is decorated with roses. On the table at the
left is a
bronze vessel of antique design overflowing with roses. Garlands of
roses hang from the chandelier and encircle the bedposts. On the small
table near the chaise-longue, a large, flat dish, also filled with
roses. In fact wherever there is any place for these flowers, they have
been used in profusion.</i></p>

<p class="normal"><i>Part of the table which stands in front of the sofa is
covered by a
napkin, upon which are seen a bottle of wine and the remains of a
luncheon for one. It is a sultry afternoon in midsummer.</i></p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Julia</span> <i>lies on the chaise-longue,
asleep. She is a beautiful woman,
about twenty-five years of age, intractable and passionate, with traces
of a bourgeois desire to be &quot;romantic.&quot; She is dressed in white,
flowing draperies, fantastically arranged.</i></p>

<p class="normal"><i>A tower clock strikes four. Then the bells of the castle
are heard
ringing. Both seem to be at a distance of about two hundred paces.</i></p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Pierre</span> <i>enters cautiously through
the tapestried doorway at the left.
He is a fashionably dressed, aristocratic young fellow who has been
petted and spoiled. He is effeminate, cowardly, arrogant, and is trying
to play the passionate man, although inwardly cold and nervous.</i></p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">(<i>Laughs in her sleep. Her laughter dies out in groans.</i>)
Pierre!
Pierre! Help! Pierre!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span> (<i>bending over her</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, yes. What is it?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Nothing-- (<i>Laughs and goes on sleeping</i>).</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span> (<i>straightening up</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Whew How hot it is! (<i>He stares at </i><span class="sc2"> Julia</span>, <i>his face
distorted by fear
and anger, and beats his forehead. Then indicating the outstretched
form of the woman.</i>) Beautiful!--You beautiful animal--you! (<i>Kneels</i>.
<span class="sc2">Julia </span><i>holds out her arms to him, but he evades her embrace.</i>) Stop!
Wake up!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span> (<i>tearfully</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Please let me sleep.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">No! Wake up! I've only come for a moment. It's tea-time, and I
have to
go back to the house.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Please stay!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">No, mamma will be asking for me. I have to be there for tea.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span> (<i>pettishly</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">I have a headache. I want some black coffee!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Then make it yourself. The gardener is cleaning the orchid
rooms in the
hot-house, and he has no time for you now.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">He never has time for me!--And the meals that his wife cooks
are simply
abominable!--And the wine is always warm!--Do, for mercy's sake, steal
the key to the icehouse!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">But you know that I can't!--I always bring you all the ice
that I can
manage to take from the table. If I insist upon having the key, the
housekeeper will tell mamma.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">But I won't drink warm wine--so there! That's what gives me
these
headaches.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Your headaches, I want to tell you, come from the roses.
Ugh!--this
nasty smell from the withered ones--sour--like stale tobacco
smoke--why, it burns the brains out of one's head!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">See here, dearie, you let the roses alone! That was our
agreement, you
know--basketsful, every morning! I wish the gardener would bring even
more! That's what he's bribed for.--More! More! Always more!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">See here, if you were only reasonable----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">But I'm not reasonable! O you--you-- (<i>She holds out her
arms to him.
He comes to her. They kiss.</i>) More!--More!--No end!--Ah, to die!----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span> (<i>freeing himself</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Oh!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">To die!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span> (<i>with hidden scorn</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Yes--to die. (<i>Yawning nervously.</i>) Pardon me!--It's as
hot as an oven
in here.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And the shutters are always closed! For eight long days I've
seen
nothing of the sun except these streaks of light. Do open the
shutters--just once!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">For Heaven's sake!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Just for a second!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">But don't you realize that the pavilion is locked and that not
a soul
ever crosses the threshold?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, yes, I know--because your lovely, reckless
great-grandmother lost
her life here a hundred years ago! That's one of those old-wives' tales
that everyone knows.--Who can tell? Perhaps my fate will be the same as
hers.--But do open the shutters!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Do be reasonable! You know that in order to come in here by
the side
door without being seen I have to crawl through the woods for a hundred
yards. The same performance twice a day--for a week! Now, if I should
open the shutters and one of the gardener's men should see it, why,
he'd come, and then----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Let him come! I'll smile at him--and he's no man if he doesn't
keep
quiet after that! Why, your old gardener would cut his hand off
for me any day of his life--just for a bit of wheedling!--It can't be
helped--they all love me!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span> (<i>aside</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Beast!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">What were you muttering then? (<span class="sc2">Pierre </span><i>throws himself down
before her
and weeps.</i>) Pierre! Crying?--Oh!--Please don't--or I'll cry too. And
my head aches so!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span> (<i>softly but nervously and
with hatred</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Do you know what I'd like to do? Strangle you!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Ha! Ha! Ha!--(<i>pityingly</i>) Dear me! Those soft
fingers--so weak!--My
little boy has read in a naughty book that people strangle their
loves--and so he wants to do some strangling too!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span> (<i>rising</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Well, what's to become of you? How much longer is the game to
last in
this pavilion?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">As long as the roses bloom--that was agreed, you know.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And then?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Bah! Then!--Why think of it? I'm here now, here under the
protection of
your lovely, ghostly great-grandmother. No one suspects--no one dreams!
My husband is searching for me the whole world over!--That was a clever
notion of mine--writing him from Brussels--Nora, last act, last
scene--and then coming straight back again! I'll wager he's in Paris
now, sitting at the Café des Anglais, and looking up and down the
street--now toward the Place de l'Opera, now toward the Madeleine. Will
you wager? I'll go you anything you say. Well, go on, wager!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">On anything else you wish--but not on that!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Why not?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Because your husband was at the castle this morning.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span> (<i>rising hastily</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">My husband--was--at the castle----?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">What's so surprising about that? He always used to come, you
know--our
nearest neighbour--and all that sort of thing.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Did he have a reason for coming?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">A special reason?--No.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Pierre--you're concealing something from me!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span> (<i>hesitating</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Nothing that I know of. No.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Why didn't you come at once? And now--why have you waited to
tell me?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span> (<i>sullenly</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">You're hearing it soon enough.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Pierre, what happened? Tell me, exactly!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Well, he came in the little runabout--without a groom--and
asked for
mamma. I naturally pretended to be going out. But you know how she
always insists on my staying with her.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And how was he was he--just the same as ever?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, no, I wouldn't say that.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">How did he look? Tell me, tell me!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">In the first place, he wore black gloves--like a gravedigger.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Ha! Ha! And what else?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">In the second place, he was everlastingly twitching his legs.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And what else? What else?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, he explained that you were at a Hungarian watering-place,
that you
were improving, and that you were expected home soon. (<span class="sc2">Julia </span><i>bursts
out laughing.</i>) Yes, (<i>gloomily</i>) it's screamingly funny, isn't it.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">So I'm at a Hungarian watering-place! Ha! Ha! Ha!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">But he looked at me so questioningly, so--so mournfully--why,
it was
really most annoying the way he looked at me.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">At a Hungarian watering-place!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And then, later, mamma said to him, &quot;It's a dreadful pity your
dear
wife isn't here just now. She does so love the roses.&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And what did he say?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Our roses are not thriving very well this year,&quot; said he.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">But his turnips!--They always thrive!--And then----?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Then a strange thing occurred that I can't help worrying
about.
Suddenly mamma said to him, &quot;Something very peculiar is happening on
our estate this year. Now I can see from where I sit that the whole
place is one mass of roses. And yet, if at any time I ask for a few
more than usual, there are none to be had!&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Why, you must have been shaking in your boots! Did you do
anything to
betray us?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, I think I know how to take care of myself!--But suddenly
he grew
absolutely rigid--as if--as if he had been reflecting. He acted like a
man who sleeps with his eyes open. Mamma asked him a question three
times, and he never answered a word!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I say, did you come here to frighten me?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span> (<i>bursting out</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">What is your fear compared to what I had to stand! Compared to
my
biting, nauseous shame as I sat there opposite him?--I scorned the man
inwardly, and yet I felt as if I ought to lick the dust on his boots.
When mamma said to him, &quot;You don't look very well, Herr Wittich--are
you ill?&quot;--her words were like the box on the ear that she gave me
when, as a lad of fifteen, I got into mischief with the steward's
daughter.--Why did you drag me into this loathsome business? I don't
like it!--I won't stand it!--I like to feel straight! I want my hands
clean!--I want to look down on the people that I meet!--I owe that to
myself.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Reproaches?--I'd like to know who has the guilty conscience in
this
case, you or I?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">How long have you been concerned about your conscience?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Pierre, you know I had never belonged to any other man--except
him.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">But you've showered sweet glances right and left. You've
flirted with
every man who would look at you--even the stable-boy wasn't beneath
your notice!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And he was better than you!--For he wanted nothing more than
to follow
me with his eyes. But you, Pierre, you were not so easily satisfied.
No, the young Count was more exacting. Corrupt to the core--in spite of
his twenty years----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span> (<i>proudly</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">I am not a bit corrupt. I am a dreamer. My twenty years excuse
that!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">But your dreams are poisonous. You want a woman to be your
mistress and
yet be chaste--to keep the blush of maidenhood and yet be as passionate
as yourself.--And what have you learned from your experience in the
world? Nothing, except how to scent and track out the sins that lie
hidden in one's inmost soul, the secret sins that one dares not admit
to oneself.--And when the prey is in reach, then you fire away with
your &quot;rights of the modern woman,&quot; your &quot;sovereignty of the freed
individuality&quot;--and whatever the rest of the phrases may be.--Ah! You
knew better than I that we all have the Scarlet Woman's blood in our
veins!--Blow away the halo--and the saint is gone!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">It seems to me you found a great deal of pleasure in your sin!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes--at least that's what one tells oneself--perhaps one feels
it,
too.--It depends--more in the evening than the morning--more in March
than October.--But the dread, the horror of it, is always there.--The
weight of such love is like the weight of one's own coffin-lid.--And
you soon discovered that, Pierre.--Then you began softly, gently, to
bind me to you with glances and caresses that were like chains of
roses!--Yes, and that I become maddened by roses as cats by valerian,
that, too, you soon found out.--Then--then you began to speak to me of
the lover's pavilion--all covered with roses--where your ancestors
spent happy, pastoral hours in wooing their loves--the pavilion that
had been waiting so long for a new mistress. You spoke of adorning it
with beautiful hangings--of filling it full of roses. Oh you, you
Pierre, how well you understood!--Do have some black coffee made for
me! If the gardener can't do it, make it yourself! Please, please!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">But, I tell you, I have to go back to mamma.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Nowadays, you always &quot;have to go back to mamma.&quot; Shall I tell
you
something--a big secret? You are tired of me! You want to get rid
of me--only you don't know how!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Your notions are offensive, my dear.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Pierre, I know my fate. I know I am doomed to the gutter. But
not
yet! Don't leave me yet! Care for me a little while longer--so the
fall won't be too sudden.--Let me stay here as long as the roses
bloom--here, where <i>he</i> can't find me! Oh, if I leave this place I
shall die of fear!--Nowhere else am I safe from those two great fists
of his!--Pierre, Pierre, you don't know his fists--they're like two
iron bolts!--You, too--beware of him!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span> (<i>half to himself</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Why do you say that to me?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">He was always jealous of you. When you sent the hothouse roses
in
April, he became suspicious. Ever since then, he has continually had
the notion of an admirer in his head. That was the danger-signal!
Pierre, if he surmised--then you would be the first--and I would come
afterward! Pierre, if you drive me to desperation, I'll give you up to
him!----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Are you mad?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I'll write him a letter something like this: &quot;If you want to
find the
traces of my flight, search the rubbish heap behind the lover's
pavilion. Search for the faded petals of the roses upon which, night
after night, Pierre and I celebrated our union. Search the highway for
the bloody prints of my bare feet after he turned me out. Then search
the dregs of the brothels where I found a refuge. And then--then avenge
me!&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">You'll do nothing of the kind, you-- (<i>Seizes her by the
wrists.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span> (<i>laughing</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Nonsense! You have no strength! (<i>Disengages herself without
difficulty.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">You've taken it out of me, you beast!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Beast?--You've been muttering that word now for a couple of
days. This
is the first time that you have flung it in my face.--What have I done
that was bestial except to throw my young life at your feet?--And so
this is the end of our rose-fête?----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span> (<i>in a low voice, breathing
with difficulty</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">No, not yet--the end is still to come!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I dare say.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">In fact--you must--leave here.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I dare say.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Do you understand?--You must leave this place--at once!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">H'm--just so.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">For--you must know--you are no longer safe here.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span> (<i>turning pale</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Not here either?--Not even here?----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I didn't tell you everything, before.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Are you up to some new trick now?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">After I had accompanied him down the steps, he asked--very
suddenly--to
see the park.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">The park----?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes. And he seemed to be searching every rose-bush as if to
count
the number of blossoms that had been cut from it. Then--in the linden
lane--I kept pushing to the left--he kept pushing to the right,
straight for the pavilion. And as it stood before us----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span> (<i>terrified</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">The pavilion?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Certainly.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span> (<i>shuddering</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">So near!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">He said he'd like to see the old thing once, from the inside.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Good heavens! But he knows that's impossible--he knows your
family
history!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And you may be sure that's how I put it to him.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And what did he----?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">He was silent--and went back.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Went back! But he'll return!----
</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">You've dumped me into a pretty mess, you have!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Do, for goodness' sake, stop pitying yourself, and tell me
what's to be
done.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Haven't I told you?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I'll not go away! I will not go away! He can't come in here! I
will not
leave this place!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Listen! I'll have a carriage here--at one o'clock in the
night--behind
the park wall. Take it as far as the station.--Listen, I tell you!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">No, no, no! As soon as I step into the street, I'm lost. And
you, too!
You don't know him! Gentle and tractable as he seems, when once he's
angry, his blood boils over!--If I hadn't taken the cartridges out of
his revolver in those days, he-- Why, I've seen him pick up two
unmanageable boys on our place and swing them over his shoulder into
the mill stream! And they would have been ground to pieces, too, if he
hadn't braced himself against the shaft. Pierre, Pierre, never get into
his way again. He's merciless!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span> (<i>feigning indifference</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, nonsense! I can hit the ace of hearts at twenty paces!
I'll show
him!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, you'll &quot;show him&quot;! Do you suppose that he's going to wait
until
you take a shot at him?--Devilish much he cares about your duels! He'd
make a clod of earth out of you before you'd have time to take off your
hat!--I tell you, bolt the gate, lock every room in the house, hide
behind your mother's chair,--and even there you won't be safe from him!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">(<i>Struggling against his growing apprehension.</i>) If
that's the case,
then--h'm, then the best thing for me to do is to disappear for a time.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span> (<i>trying to cling to him</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, let's go away together!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span> (<i>moving aside</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">That might suit you.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">But, after all, it would do no good. We could hide among
crowds of
people--in Piccadilly or in Batignolles--we could go to India or to
Texas--and yet, if he took it into his head, he would find us none the
less. Even if we should evade him--some day, sooner or later, you would
have to return--and then--you would have to pay the penalty!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span> (<i>stammering</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">I--would--have to----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span> (<i>wildly</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">So stay--stay here! Go and shoot him down!--at night--from
behind!--It
doesn't matter! Only--let--me--breathe--again.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Do you want to drive me mad? Don't you see that I'm trembling
all over?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Because you're a cad and a coward--because----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, yes--anything, for all I care! But go! Leave my property!
Insult
me, spit on me,--but go!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And what then? What then?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Can't you write to him? Tell him that you have come back from
your
little journey--that you have reconsidered--that you can't live without
him. Tell him to forget--and all shall be as it was before.--Now,
wouldn't that be splendid?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Now when he suspects?--When he can follow me, step by step,
here to
this pavilion and back again? (<i>Contemptuously.</i>) Splendid!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Then try something else!--Oh, now I have it! Now I have it!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Speak, Pierre, for God's sake, speak! I'll love you as--!
Speak! Speak!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">You know him. His heart is soft?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, except when he's in a rage, then----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And you are sure that he loves you deeply?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">If he didn't love me so much, what need we fear?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Good! Well then, take a carriage at the station and drive
home; throw
yourself at his feet and tell him everything. Tell him, for all I care,
that you hate me--that you loathe me--I don't mind--grovel before him
until he raises you. And then all will be well!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Ah, if it were possible!--It would be deliverance--it would be
heaven!
I should be safe once more--a human being!--I should see the sun again,
instead of these streaks of light!--I should breathe the fresh air,
instead of this musty odour of dead roses!--I shouldn't have to sink
down, down into the filth!--I shouldn't have to be a bad woman--even if
I am one!--There would be a respectable divorce--or perhaps merely a
separation. For, I no longer dare hope to live with him as his wife,
even if I were satisfied to be no better than his dog for the rest of
my days!--Ah, but it cannot be! It cannot be! You don't know him. You
don't know what he's like when the veins stand out on his forehead!--He
would kill me!--Rather than that--kill me yourself!--Here--now--this
moment!--Get your duelling pistols. Oh no! There--there--there are
plenty of weapons! (<i>She pulls at the weapons on the wall, several of
which fall clattering upon the floor.</i>) Swords--daggers--here! (<i>Throws
an armful on the chaise-longue.</i>) They are rusty--but that doesn't
matter.--Take one! Stab me first--then--do as you please!--Live if you
can--do!--live as happily as you can! Your life is in your hands.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes--I dare say. Live!--But how? Where? (<i>Sobs chokingly.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Come, then--we'll die together--together! (<i>They sink into
each other's
arms and remain motionless in mute despair. After a time</i>, Julia
<i>raises her head cautiously and looks about her.</i>) Pierre!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span> (<i>troubled</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Well?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Has it occurred to you? Perhaps it isn't so, after all!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">What do you mean?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Perhaps we've just been talking ourselves into this notion,
little by
little--think so?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">You mean that he really wanted to do nothing but--look at the
pavilion?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Well, it's possible, you know.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes--at least nothing very unusual occurred.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">But your naughty, naughty conscience came and asserted itself.
Ha! Ha!
What a silly little boy it is! A downright stupid little boy!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">My imagination was always rather easily aroused. I----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span> (<i>laughing without restraint</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Such a stupid boy!--Pierre, let's make some coffee--for a
change, eh?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">But you know--I have to----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Dear me, mamma has had her tea long ago. Tell her you sat down
in the
shade--and fell asleep--anything! It's growing a bit shady here now.
See there! The streaks of light have gone. (<i>Indicates a corner of the
room in which the streaks of light have just grown dim.</i>) Ah! but how
hot it is! (<i>Tears her dress open at the throat, breathing heavily.</i>)
Will you bring me the coffee-pot, like a good boy?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span> (<i>listlessly</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, well--all right. (<i>Carries the coffee-pot to the table.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Pierre, you--you couldn't open the small door just a tiny bit?
No one
would look into the shrubbery.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Well, out there in the shrubbery, it's even hotter than in
here.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, just try it--won't you?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Well, you'll see! (<i>Opens the door at the left.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Whew! It's like a blast from a furnace! And that disgusting
odour--a
mixture of perspiration and bad perfume--ugh!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">That's from the roses of our by-gone days--they lie out there
in great
heaps.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Close the door! Hurry--close it!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span> (<i>does so</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">I told you how it would be!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Well, perhaps you could adjust the shutters at the large door
so that
we'd get more fresh air in here.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Even that would be dangerous. If some one happened to be
looking this
way and saw the movement----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span> (<i>going to the door</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">One has to do it slowly, ve-ry slow-ly-- (<i>She starts,
uttering a low
cry of fear, and retreats to the foreground, her arms outstretched as

<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">What's the matter?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Sh! Sh! (<i>Approaches him cautiously, then softly.</i>)
There's a man--out
there.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Where?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Hush! Come here you can see it against the light. (<i>They
cautiously
change places</i>. <span class="sc2">Pierre </span><i>utters a low shriek, then </i><span class="sc2">Julia</span>, <i>softly,
despairingly</i>) Pierre!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">It must be the gardener.</p>

<p class="normal">I can't.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Then I will. (<i>She has taken but a few steps toward the door

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">How--gone?</p>

heavily in walking. He speaks in a stammering, hesitating voice; he

<p class="normal">He won't hurt us.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span> (<i>stammering</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">I simply--don't--understand it--at all!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span> (<i>pointing to </i><span class="sc2">Wittich</span>).</p>

<p class="normal">Try it! Go to him!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">He's not a bit like himself.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Go on! Go on!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">(<i>Who has timidly approached her husband, bid has drawn back
at a
movement of his, suddenly throws herself at his feet with great
emotion.</i>) George! George!--I am guilty!--I have sinned before
God and you!--I acknowledge my crime!--My life is in your hands!--Crush
me--grind me to dust!--But God knows, I only obeyed a wretched impulse.
My love for you has never left my heart.--My one desire is to die. Kill
me!--Here!--Now!--But forgive me! Ah, forgive me!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Wittich</span> (<i>staring straight ahead</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, they always talk like that--in books, at least.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Forgive me!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Wittich</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">There is nothing to forgive. And I am not going to kill any
one. What
good would it do? (<span class="sc2">Julia </span><i>sobs, hiding her face in her hands.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Well, then--don't kneel there--like that--Julia, dear!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I shall lie here until he raises me. Raise me! Take me in your
arms!
Oh, George----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Wittich</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, that's what they always say. (<i>Sinks into reverie
again.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span> (<i>aside to her</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Hush! Stand up! (<i>She does so.</i>) Well--h'm--I suppose I
may assume,
Herr Wittich, that you had some purpose in seeking this interview?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Wittich</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes--yes. (<i>Looking about him.</i>) I can well imagine that
my
wife--er--that the lady must find it very pleasant here.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, yes--we needn't hesitate to say that, need we, Julia,
dear?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span> (<i>uncertainly adopting his
tone</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">No, indeed, Pierre, dear.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Wittich</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">At least--she seems to have plenty of roses here.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span> (<i>laughing nervously</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, yes--plenty.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Wittich</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">May I ask whether the lady has made any arrangements for the
future?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span> (<i>still timidly</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">I was thinking of making my home in Paris, wasn't I, Pierre?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes. You see, Julia wants to live a life suited to her tastes
and
inclinations--a life such as she cannot have even here--a life
consecrated to Beauty and Art.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Wittich</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">They say that an existence of that sort comes high. Has my
wife--er--has the lady made any provision for her expenses?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span> (<i>embarrassed</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">From the moment that I become of age I shall be in a position
to--h'm--h'm----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Wittich</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I see. But <i>until</i> that moment--?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I--er----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Wittich</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Well, I consider it my duty--and mine alone--to protect the
woman
whom--until recently--I called my wife. And to save her from ruin, I am
willing to make any sacrifice whatsoever.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, as for that, of course----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Wittich</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I intend to put no obstacle in the way of your desire to
legitimize
your relations.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Very kind of you--really--very thoughtful indeed.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Wittich</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Not because--not that I don't dare insist upon <i>my</i>
rights in this
affair, but because I want to guard <i>her</i> from lifelong misery.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Really, you wouldn't believe how often we have discussed this
question--would he, Julia, dear?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">But I am never going to grant your wish, Pierre, dear. You
shall keep
your liberty--you shall be free! Even as I ask nothing better than to
follow my own inclinations. If I am ruined because of them--well, it's
no one's concern but my own--no one's! (<i>Tosses her head.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Wittich</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">May I inquire what those inclinations are?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">It's hard to say--off-hand.--You must feel it--you must--
Well, I want
to be free!--I want to hold my fate in my own hands!--I want-- Oh, why
talk about it? What is one poor, human life?--especially a life like
mine!--I am branded--doomed to the gutter!--One need use no ceremony
with me now!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Wittich</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Really! Well--h'm--if I had known that you felt that way about
it--I
should have made you--a different proposition--Julia, dear.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Tell me! Please!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes--tell us--please!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Wittich</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I suppose I may assume that the people at the castle know
nothing of
this little adventure of the young Count's?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">You may rest assured, my dear sir, that I know what is due a
woman's
honour.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Wittich</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Ah--really!--Well, I'm sure no one saw me coming here. So
then, there
need be no scandal.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">That would certainly be most agreeable to all parties
concerned.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Wittich</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">But--how did the lady propose to leave here without being
seen?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Pray, my dear sir, let that be my concern.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Wittich</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">That concern, however, I shall share with you--my dear sir.
And it
seems to me that the best plan would be for the lady to put on a decent
dress, walk through the grounds with me, and pay a visit to the
Countess at the castle.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">What!--my mother--? What's the use of that?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Wittich</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">It will look as if she'd returned--and we'd--somehow--met
here.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Do you think any one is going to believe that?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Wittich</span> (<i>proudly</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">What else should they believe?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span> (<i>frightened anew</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, but I don't want to! I don't want to do that! Pierre! I
want to
stay with you! I am under your protection, Pierre!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">See here, my dear sir, let us suppose that your plan is
successful--what then?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes--yes--afterward--what then?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Wittich</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Then?--Then-- (<i>Looks from one to the other, uncertainly,
almost
imploringly, and breaks down again.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Well--won't you go on with your proposition?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Wittich</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, I suppose that when a man has acted as I have acted here,
he must
have lost--his sense of pride--and honour--and all the rest of it--long
ago.--Then nothing is left him but--his duty.--And the thing that seems
to me my--duty--I am going to do.--Let the Count sneer at me--I no
longer----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, please--I say!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Wittich</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Well, then, let me tell you something, Julia. After I had read
the
letter from Brussels, I had two rooms prepared for you--in the left
wing--quite apart; so that some day, in case--you ever--came back-- Oh,
well--it doesn't matter now. But the rooms--are--still there--and if
you would like to come home with me now--straight off--well, you might
be spared--some annoyance.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">H'm--so you're willing--? (<i>Shrugs his shoulders and laughs.</i>)
I
suppose that sort of thing is all a matter of taste--but I can
understand----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Wittich</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I am speaking to you, Julia.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, I thank you most heartily, George. It's certainly very
noble
of you--and--I deeply appreciate it. But after--this, I should
always feel ashamed before you--I should feel that I was just being
tolerated--I-- No. Thank you, George--but I couldn't stand it.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span> (<i>correcting her</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">That is--! (<i>Aside to </i><span class="sc2">Julia</span>.) Don't be a fool!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Wittich</span> (<i>without noticing </i>
<span class="sc2">Pierre</span>).</p>

<p class="normal">You shall never hear a word of reproach from my lips, Julia,
dear.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">But--if I should actually accept--we never could go on as we
did
before, you know. I must be free to do exactly as I please--to go
away--come back--just as I like. There is such a thing as the
sovereignty of the individuality, my dear George--you can't deny that.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Herr Wittich can't possibly deny that!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Wittich</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">You shall have your own way as far as it lies in my power,
Julia, dear.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And then, you must try to bring a little more--more beauty
into our
life.--I surely have the right to demand that. Just look about you
here. You know how passionately fond of roses I am. My soul demands
something besides--potatoes! Well, I insist upon having roses around
me. That's not unreasonable, is it?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Wittich</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">You shall have roses enough to smother you.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span> (<i>nervously</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Well, then, Julia, dear, I see no reason why we should not
accept this
proposition.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Wittich</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">What have you got to say about it?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I beg your pardon, Herr Wittich. I certainly don't want to
offend you.
But--as Julia and I have found so much in each other--haven't we,
Julia, dear?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes--so very, very much, Pierre, dear.--And to know that we
were so
near--and yet could never see each other or talk together, or-- I, for
my part, couldn't endure it, could you, Pierre?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh--as for that--well, it would be hard, Julia, dear.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And what would the world say, dear George, if we should
suddenly--and
apparently without any cause--break off all communication with our
neighbors? How would Pierre explain it to his mother? Why, he simply
couldn't! No; if we are to carry out your plan, then everything must
remain outwardly the same as before. Don't you agree with me, Pierre,
dear?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">(<i>Hesitating, with an apprehensive glance toward </i>
<span class="sc2">Wittich</span>.) Outwardly--yes, Julia, dear.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Wittich</span> (<i>losing control of himself</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">So that's your condition, is it?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span> (<i>with a sort of nervous
impudence</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, that's our condition--isn't it, Pierre, dear? (<span class="sc2">Pierre </span><i>
does not reply, but looks at </i><span class="sc2">Wittich</span>.)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Wittich</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Really?--Really!--Very well! (<i>He draws himself to his full
height, his
face flushes, and he looks around the room wildly, as if searching for
something.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">What are you looking for, George?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Wittich</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">If you-- (<i>Gasps as if suffocating.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">George! George! What's the matter?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Wittich</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">There--there--there! (<i>With a loud cry, he falls upon the
weapons and
snatches one of the daggers.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Julia</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Help! Help! Pierre! Save me!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Pierre</span> (<i>at the same time</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Help! Help! (<i>He pushes open the door and escapes, screaming</i>.
<span class="sc2">Julia </span>
<i>rushes out through the door at the left</i>. <span class="sc2">Wittich </span><i>dashes after her. A
piercing shriek is heard. After a short pause</i>, <span class="sc2">Julia </span><i>appears at the
large door in the centre. She tries to go further, fails, supports
herself against the door posts for an instant, and then reels into the
room. She attempts to lean against the small table in the centre, but
falls to the floor, dying. As she falls the small table is upset,
burying her beneath a shower of roses.</i></p>

<p class="normal"><i>Through the doorway at the left</i>, <span class="sc2">Wittich </span><i>is heard,
sobbing and
groaning. In the distance </i><span class="sc2">Pierre </span><i>is shouting for help. The sound of
many voices, growing louder as the curtain falls.</i>)</p>

<p class="normal"><i>The richly furnished office of a prosperous lawyer.
Pictures, bronzes,
carved furniture, costly hangings. In the foreground, on the left, a
window; turned toward it, a writing-table with a writing-chair behind.
Near the window, a leather arm-chair. At the narrow side of the table,
in the foreground, a low seat. On the right, a sofa, table, and chairs.
In the background, a door which, when opened, reveals the clerks
working at long tables. To the right, back, another door. The backward
projection of the writing-table forms a revolving-stand for reference
books. On the writing-table, among documents and writing materials, are
photographs in standing frames and a slender vase filled with dark red
roses.</i></p>

<p class="normal"><i>It is winter, about six o'clock in the evening. The lamps are
lighted.</i></p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc2">Ebeling </span><i>is seated in the
writing-chair. He is a man of about forty,
attractive, winning in manner, his clothes betokening wealth and
refinement; he wears a short, dark beard, and his hair is slightly gray
at the temples</i>. <span class="sc2">Von Tietz</span>, <i>sitting opposite him
in the arm-chair, is
about thirty, very smartly dressed--in appearance a type of the
ordinary drawing-room devotee.</i></p>

<p class="normal">There! Now let's chat. Will you smoke?</p>

<p class="normal">Really now--if I'm disturbing you----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">See here, my dear fellow, if you were disturbing me, I'd make
short
work of you. But (<i>looking toward the clock</i>) my office hours are over.
And we'll find out immediately what else there is. (<i>He rings.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Bonath</span> <i>appears with a bundle of
papers</i>.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Is any one still there?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Bonath</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">No, Herr Ebeling, but a lady is expected.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, I know. Well, let me have the papers. (<span class="sc2">Bonath </span><i>lays
them before
him.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">(<i>To </i><span class="sc2">v. Tietz</span>.) You can go on speaking. These are only
signatures.--Have you a light?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Tietz</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">(<i>Who has stood up and is looking around the room.</i>) Yes,
thank you.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">See that this decision is delivered to Baron von Kanoldt at
once.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Bonath</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, Herr Ebeling.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Tietz</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">You've become a collector, I see.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span> (<i>signing</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">One must have some diversion.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Tietz</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">What's that? Looks like a Terburg. Is it an original?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span> (<i>signing</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Would you expect it to be a copy?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Tietz</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">H'm, your practice is certainly splendid.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">There are a lot of people, though, who think they are cleverer
than
I--and take great pains to justify their opinion. (<i>To </i><span class="sc2">Bonath</span>.) Will
it be necessary to work overtime?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Bonath</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Not to-day, Herr Ebeling.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Then you can announce Frau von Yburg as soon as she comes. (<span class="sc2">v.
Tietz </span><i>listens attentively.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Bonath</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Very well, Herr Ebeling. (<i>Goes out.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Tietz</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">The lady you are expecting is Frau von Yburg?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Of course you know that I've been the Yburg's legal adviser
for years.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Tietz</span> (<i>sitting down</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Well, really, this is quite a marvellous coincidence. It's on
account
of the Yburgs that I've come to see you.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span> (<i>interested</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Is that so? What's the matter?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Tietz</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">My dear friend, if you hadn't so completely drawn away from
all society
since your wife l---- (<i>alarmed.</i>) I beg your pardon.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Go on! Say it! Left me! Walked out of the house! You may say
it. But
then--drop it! Even our old fraternity friendship doesn't oblige us to
be everlastingly putting each other on the grill.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Tietz</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">No, really--it escaped me somehow. I'm awfully sorry.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, well, never mind. You know, I speak of it quite
disinterestedly.
And it's a good many years since then. Only--I'd rather not be attacked
unawares.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Tietz</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Don't worry. I'll be on my guard. But--as we've mentioned
it--there's
something I wanted to ask you before--only I hadn't the courage. Tell
me, do you always keep her picture on your table?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span> (<i>in a hard voice</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Yes.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Tietz</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Then you still love her?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">No. I only keep the picture there to warn me against making a
fool of myself again. So many charming women sit there where you're
sitting, women just on the point of divorce--and therefore in
need of consolation. Every now and then one of them undertakes to
faint--um--and then I have to-- (<i>Holds out his arms.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Tietz</span> (<i>bursting out laughing</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Aha! Very interesting! Very interesting!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">In short, it does no harm to keep the picture there.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Tietz</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Of course, everyone knows how much courted you are. For
instance, no
matter when I come to see you, I always find those beautiful roses on
your table. They speak for themselves. Heavens! What a luxury! Roses in
January!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Things like that come anonymously. If I knew who the sender
was, I
wouldn't accept them.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Tietz</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Let me with all due modesty give you a piece of advice: you
ought to
marry.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">(<i>Ironically, shaking his finger at him across the table.</i>)
Thank you.
But didn't you want to speak to me about the Yburgs?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Tietz</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes. What was I going to say?--Oh, yes. Well, if you hadn't
taken it
into your head to live like a hermit, you'd know that, for some time
past, I've been a very frequent visitor at the Yburgs's.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, yes, I know. I go there myself sometimes--only not when
other
people are around.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Tietz</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Well, then, to make a long story short--why should I mince
matters with
you?--I am courting Margot.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span> (<i>startled</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Ah--you, too? You're also one of the crowd?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Tietz</span> (<i>conceitedly</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">I trust that I stand up a bit above the crowd.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Indeed? I thought perhaps the social glamour of the Yburgs was
attracting you. A thing like that can't help dazzling one. But
that you----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Tietz</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Is it so surprising? That girl is so bewitching--so--so
entirely unlike
these forward, city-bred girls. With her, at least, one knows what one
can count on. She's so--so the essence of everything innocent and
chaste and pure.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span> (<i>quoting</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow,&quot;--thy dowry shall
not
escape me.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Tietz</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">No, no--don't joke. It's out of place. I won't deny that, as
an
official without fortune--that would also be very--h'm--but----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, but what have I got to do with it?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Tietz</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">See here, my dear friend, we scattered remnants of the old
college
fraternity have grown so accustomed to ask your help in times of need,
to look up to you as a sort of father confessor----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Do you want me to go and propose for you?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Tietz</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">We'll talk of that later. But first I'd like to ask you
something. See
here, what rôle is Baron von Kanoldt playing in this family?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">So that's it!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Tietz</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">You're his counsel in his divorce proceedings, aren't you?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">As the affair has become common talk, I need make no secret of
it.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Tietz</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">They say that it is the wife who has been the martyr. And yet,
after
fifteen years, <i>he</i> begins the divorce proceedings. Why should he?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">My dear fellow, you must put that question to some one who's
not so
well informed as I am.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Tietz</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, see here, I don't want to be indiscreet about it, but the
further
the case goes, the more persistent are the rumours that he has designs
on Margot's hand--and, furthermore, that her mother is encouraging him!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Frau von Yburg will be here in a few minutes.--Ask her!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Tietz</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">What do you take me for?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span> (<i>shrugging his shoulders</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, well then----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Tietz</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">But just think! that man--forty, if he's a day, fat, worn out,
a roué
whose amorous adventures are common gossip to every cabby on the
street!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Pardon me, my clients are all virtuous, young, handsome,
desirable--of
inestimable pulchritude.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Tietz</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">See here--are you chaffing me?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I'm only trying to make you understand that you've unwittingly
walked
into the enemy's camp.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Tietz</span> (<i>standing up</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Very well--if you don't want to----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">(<i>Also stands up, and puts his hand on </i><span class="sc2">v. Tietz's </span><i>

fellow, you're ten years younger than I. You're one of your country's
young hopefuls. Go ahead and do what your heart and pocket-book bid
you.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Tietz</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I didn't need you to tell me that. (<i>A knock at the door.</i>)</p>

<span class="sc2">Frau v. Yburg </span><i>is a woman of about forty, dressed simply but
tastefully; her bearing is dignified, self-possessed, refined, and

<p class="normal">Ah!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau v. Yburg</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I brought my little girl along, Herr Ebeling, to let her catch
a

<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span> (<i>kissing her hand</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">A thousand times welcome, dear ladies. (<i>Shakes hands with </i><span class="sc2">

<p class="normal">Good evening, Herr von Tietz. This is indeed a pleasure. (<i>Gives

<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Tietz</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I'm very happy to meet you both--I hadn't hoped to see
Fräulein Yburg
here. But our friend believes in military promptitude. I have just
received permission to take my leave.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau v. Yburg</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I hope that you will come to see us soon, Herr von Tietz.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Tietz</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">That's very kind of you. (<i>Bowing to </i><span class="sc2">Margot</span>.) Fräulein
Yburg!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span> (<i>accompanying him to the

<p class="normal">Good-bye, my dear fellow. No bad feelings now----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Tietz</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, I say! Of course not! (<i>Goes out.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Won't you sit down?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau v. Yburg</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, no. Margot is only going to glance around a bit. Yes, my
little
girl, you may well look about. Between these four walls many a fate has
been shaped.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Let us rather say, has been mended.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Margot</span> (<i>softly, suddenly looking up</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Mine, too?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau v. Yburg</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">(<i>Looking at her with evident disapproval.</i>) Perhaps
Margot may call
for me again in half an hour. You won't mind?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">It will give me great pleasure.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau v. Yburg</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Then run away, dear, pay your visit, and let the carriage
bring you

<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Au revoir, Fräulein Margot. (<i>Accompanies her to the door,

Bonath, see to it that Fräulein Yburg finds her way out. She is coming
back later.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><i>Voice of </i><span class="sc2">Bonath</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Very well, Herr Ebeling.</p>

<p class="center">(<span class="sc2">Ebeling </span><i>bows to </i><span class="sc2">Margot</span>, <i>who is already out of

<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Well, Frau von Yburg, we've brought matters to this point.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau v. Yburg</span> (<i>sighing</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Yes.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">The divorce was granted yesterday morning.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau v. Yburg</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, I know.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Well, aren't you pleased?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau v. Yburg</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">My dear Herr Ebeling, my heart is so full of
gratitude--really, I don't
know how to thank you--for myself and also for my poor, dear child. But
I'm so helpless--so perplexed--I really don't know--I----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Why, what can be wrong?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau v. Yburg</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes--just fancy--well, then--<i>she won't do it!</i></p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span> (<i>astonished</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">What's that?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau v. Yburg</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Think of the monstrosity of it! She won't do it.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Has she been notified that the divorce has been granted?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau v. Yburg</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yesterday--just after the proceedings--Baron von
Kanoldt--came--with
his proposal.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">H'm!--quicker than I had expected.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau v. Yburg</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">My husband, of course, was simply thunderstruck. One can
surely
sympathise with him--von Kanoldt--a man in the forties--divorced--with
grown children--and <i>such</i> a reputation! But when he saw that I took
the man's part--I had to do that, didn't I?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">That was our only course.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau v. Yburg</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Then his position, his wealth, his connections at court--oh,
yes, and
naturally our long friendship-- Of course, my husband doesn't surmise
what this man did to her! In the end, he agreed that Margot herself
should decide.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Well, and--? What----?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau v. Yburg</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">She came, looked him quietly in the face, and asked for time
to think
it over.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">It seems to me your husband was very clever. Otherwise, he
might
perhaps have----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau v. Yburg</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, but when we were alone, just fancy! she declared quite
simply:
&quot;No, I won't do it.&quot; I exclaimed, &quot;Why, my dear child, you're out of
your mind! You know that we've done everything for the sake of this
day!&quot; &quot;Yes, I know all about it--but I won't.&quot; &quot;You've been wishing it
for three years,&quot; I said to her. And what do you suppose she answered!
&quot;I never wished it. You talked it into me--and he.&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He?&quot; Pardon me, who?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau v. Yburg</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">You, Herr Ebeling.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span> (<i>standing up in his
excitement</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">My dear lady, it was my duty to carry out what you and
Fräulein Margot
desired--and what, in short, the circumstances demanded.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau v. Yburg</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, I know! My God, how well I realise it! And what a task
you've
accomplished! No--when I remember how much persuasion, how much subtle
reasoning, how much-- Ah, and how I've suffered these three years! See,
my hair is quite gray!--And I still can't understand it! I still look
upon the girl as if she were a stranger, a mysterious being who has
lost her way and accidentally come to me. I--I who was brought up so
strictly, watched, and carefully tended all my life, kept worlds away
from any taint of the unconventional-- And she, too-- No, on that
point, I can't reproach myself. And yet--this horror! No, I shall
never, never understand it! Ah, and to have to bear it all alone! Oh,
yes, I had to do that. My husband, with his long army training, would
have forced him to fight--and then we should all have been dragged in
the dust. Margot's life--our position in society--everything! Ah, if
you hadn't been here, Herr Ebeling! Do you remember how I came to you?
I think I was half dead from wretchedness! With the letter to him in my
hand, the letter that I had taken from her as she lay distracted in my
arms! Do you remember?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, don't speak of it! As I read that handwriting--still so
childish--and that helpless, stammering question: &quot;What has happened to
me?&quot;--God knows, everything turned black before my eyes! Oh! it's too
horrible!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau v. Yburg</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And then you yourself said to me, &quot;You're right--the
blackguard <i>must</i>.
I'll make him.&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I said it in the heat of the first great indignation. Please
take that
into consideration. After I went to work, I religiously kept to my
programme to leave all threats and violence out of the question. Not
only because-- Ah, as I've come to feel now, such a calm method of
procedure would be impossible. But then I had to keep in mind that a
new life--I don't venture to say a happy one--was to be gained through
me. To-day, some one is grateful to me--the very one who at first
opposed me most violently--that poor, wretched wife.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau v. Yburg</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And now everything would have been forgiven. I can't
understand it. I
don't know--I----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">So she won't do it?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau v. Yburg</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And that's why I've fled to you in my need! Later, when she
returns, I
want to have gone. You understand? I've arranged it this way so that
you could bring her to her senses. A little heart to heart talk, you
know. But if your influence doesn't help, then I don't know--then----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span> (<i>walking up and down</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">And so she won't do it.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau v. Yburg</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, just explain it to me! The only possible way in which to
rehabilitate herself in her own eyes! And she throws it to the winds!
What can she be thinking of? What----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And so she won't do it!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau v. Yburg</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">What's come over you, Herr Ebeling? You're not listening!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span> (<i>firmly, quietly</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Very well, then she <i>shall</i> not.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau v. Yburg</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">For God's sake! You, too! You, too, want----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">My dear friend, I have done all that lay in my power, often
against my
own convictions, I can assure you. She knows what she is doing. She
will not. Very well. I'm not here to bait her to her ruin. I am very
sorry, but this time I must refuse my assistance.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau v. Yburg</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">But what will happen? Must all our work count for
nothing--your work,
my work? For I have worked over her with all my powers, I need not
hesitate to say it, worked to place her again on those spiritual
heights where a young girl of family by right belongs. I have led her
back to Religion, for whoever has anything to expiate must possess
Religion. I have read with her only the most carefully selected books,
books that could never, never endanger a young girl's imagination. And
I have taken special care to see to it that when she was in the company
of young people, she should, if possible, be stricter and even more
reserved than the most timid of her friends. For her need of such
behaviour was double theirs, wasn't it? And you yourself will admit
that my efforts have been successful. No one could deny it and look
into those clear, steadfast eyes of hers. (<span class="sc2">Ebeling </span><i>nods assent.</i>) She
has become all soul--all----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span> (<i>doubtingly, sadly</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Ah!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau v. Yburg</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, indeed, Herr Ebeling. No clandestine, no unseemly wish
finds its
way into her heart. I'll vouch for that. She glides through life like a
silent spirit, cleansed and purified.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And therefore we are to throw her into the jaws of that beast.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau v. Yburg</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Is there any other way? Do you know of any?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span> (<i>tormented</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">H'm! She certainly has suitors enough!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau v. Yburg</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">She'll reject them all--as she has heretofore. She simply
says, &quot;I
shall not begin my new life with a lie. I think too much of myself for
that. And to confess, to tell the man, and have him turn his back on
me, or out of pure pity raise me to his own level--I think <i>entirely</i>
too much of myself for that.&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I believe one can readily appreciate her feelings.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau v. Yburg</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">But what will become of her? Is she to wither and wear
away--this
heavenly young creature? (<span class="sc2">Ebeling </span><i>walks about, growing more and more
excited. A pause.</i>) Herr Ebeling, speak! Advise me!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span> (<i>firmly</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">I know of only one solution: she must choose some one who
knows it.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau v. Yburg</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Who could that be--except----?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span> (<i>breathing heavily</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Except that man, there is only one other.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau v. Yburg</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">(<i>Stares at him uncomprehendingly with her hands clasped,
then
stammering.</i>) Oh! oh, God! What a joy that would be!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">What more can I say? Such things come and grow great in a man,
one
knows not how. She bore <i>her</i> sorrow, <i>her</i> shame, I mine. At first,
perhaps, it was no more than a casual fancy--no, an interest, for my
inclinations were always involved--but to-day it has become a passion,
a passion that, lonely man as I am, gnaws me to the very core of my
being.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau v. Yburg</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">But how have you managed through it all to keep so quiet, so
deliberate, so----?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">One learns, little by little, to be master of oneself. And
five minutes
ago there was absolutely no hope, (<i>bursting out</i>) but if she no longer
wants him--why shouldn't I--oh! (<i>Hides his face in his hand, trembling
with emotion.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau v. Yburg</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Wait! I don't see, after you've led him on to this point, how
you'll
ever justify all this to Baron von Kanoldt.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I don't know! Until now, I've led a tolerably respectable
life. For, in
the disgrace that <i>she</i> (<i>pointing to the picture of his wife</i>)
brought
upon me, I played no part.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau v. Yburg</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, yes, everyone in society knows that.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">But I haven't once asked myself whether what I am now going to
do--or
should like to do--conforms to the prevailing standards of propriety.
One ought to think it over, to let some time elapse--in short, I don't
know! All I can say is that if she doesn't want him, if she won't take
that--(<i>checking himself</i>)--him, well, then, the path is open to
any one--to me as well as to another.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau v. Yburg</span> (<i>hesitating</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">I feel that I ought to warn you of just one thing more. She
has never
seemed to consider you as anything more than a fatherly sort of friend.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">H'm! (<i>Laughs bitterly.</i>) Even though I'm a couple of
years younger
than----, I've certainly acted more like a father to her. But you're
probably right. (<i>Knocking.</i>) Come in. (<span class="sc2">Bonath </span><i>enters.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Bonath</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I've let the clerks go home. Have you any further orders, Herr
Ebeling?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">You can go, too, Bonath. But tell my man to answer the door.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Bonath</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Very well, Herr Ebeling. Good evening. (<span class="sc2">Bonath </span><i>goes out.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Frau von Yburg, your daughter will return in a few minutes.
Meanwhile,
the scene has changed not altogether insignificantly. Do you still
approve of that little private heart to heart talk--or not?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau v. Yburg</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Ah, my dear friend, I have such boundless confidence in you.
You've
been her good angel for so long. I don't hesitate for a moment to leave
her in your hands. And you'll carefully observe all the conventions? Of
course you will.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">But what can I say to her?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau v. Yburg</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">You're so skilled in reading the heart. You'll have found a
way to
make her confess something before she's aware of it. Only let me beg of
you--if you find nothing in what she says that gives you reason to
hope, then please don't worry her. She has already suffered so much.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Very well, then, I'll proceed upon the assumption that I have
only to
comply with the request that brought you to me to-day.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau v. Yburg</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">If you would----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Hush! (<i>Listens at the door, then pointing to the right.</i>)
May I ask
you to go out this door? You know your way.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau v. Yburg</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And please, please, spare her delicacy. You've no idea how
pure she
is--in spite of----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">If I didn't know <i>that</i>-- (<i>Knocking. He opens the
door, right.</i>)
Good-bye.</p>

<p class="normal">(<span class="sc2">Frau v. Yburg </span><i>goes out.</i>)</p>

<p class="normal">What, my dear child?</p>

<p class="normal">It isn't usually mamma's way to go off without me.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Then I'll take you home myself. You need have no fears.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, I'm not afraid.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span> (<i>inviting her to sit down</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Won't you----?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Margot</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I'd like to look around a bit first; may I? I couldn't a while
ago.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I'm only too happy to think that you take some interest in my
home.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Margot</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Dear me, mamma has so often told me about it. Of late years
her visits
to you were our principal topic of conversation. I think I've known
every tiny nook here for a long, long time.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Really?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Margot</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, there's the stand with the horrible law books! (<i>Sighing.</i>)
Ah,
Herr Ebeling, everything in life is Law--and everything is in books.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">My dear young girl, the hardest laws are never to be found in
books.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Margot</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, you are right. The laws that drag us down to destruction
are the
laws that we make for ourselves. And all those beautiful women! I
suppose one must be very beautiful to join them?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span> (<i>parrying lightly</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Most of them are clients who have presented me with their
pictures as a
token of gratitude.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Margot</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Well, but I'm your client, too--and yet I should never dare to
offer
you my picture in that way.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">If you only----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Margot</span> (<i>startled</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, and there's your-- (<i>Looks at him questioningly,
confused.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, that's my former wife.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Margot</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I saw her only once in my life. I was a mere child then. She
was very
lovely.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, she was lovely.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Margot</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, and the wonder--wonderful roses! Mamma has told me that
you always
have such lovely roses.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span> (<i>lightly</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, I have an agreement with a gardener. He keeps me
supplied.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Margot</span> (<i>seemingly convinced</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Oh!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">May I present them to you, Fräulein Margot?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Margot</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, dear me, no. The gardener who keeps you supplied might be
offended.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span> (<i>laughing</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">As you wish.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Margot</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And this is the inquisitional chair--where the poor secrets
are dragged
out?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Quite the contrary! The secrets come forth of their own
accord. I
always have to say &quot;stop.&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Margot</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Well, then, I needn't hesitate to sit down. (<i>Does so.</i>) <i>
My</i> secret
you know--(<i>sighing</i>)--only too well!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">My dear Fräulein Margot; the real secret of your life, the law
that
governs your thoughts and feelings, I believe no one knows--not even
your mother.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Margot</span> (<i>smiling and shrugging her
shoulders</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">My good mamma! And I'm here to give you proofs of that fact,
am I?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span> (<i>evasively</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Oh!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Margot</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">The reason for my being here isn't the one you've given me.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Indeed! What is it?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Margot</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I wasn't left here alone for nothing! Please go ahead, Herr
Ebeling, do
your duty and talk me nicely into marrying Baron von--(<i>shudders</i>).
See?--I've never once been able to bring his name to my lips. And yet
I'm to pass my whole life with that man! Can one picture anything more
horrible? (<i>Shudders again.</i>) Do you know of any occupation for me,
Herr Ebeling?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Occupation? Why?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Margot</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I want to leave home.</p>

<p class="normal">Ebeling</p>

<p class="normal">Is that your earnest intention?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Margot</span> (<i>nods</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">But, unfortunately, I've learned nothing. And then--it has to
be an
occupation that wouldn't humiliate me--and that wouldn't spoil my hands
(<i>takes off her gloves</i>), for I love my hands. I don't care a bit about
my face, but my hands--they're like two friends. I can keep up long
conversations with them--especially with the left. That one's so weak.
So, something that wouldn't spoil the hands--and would leave me time
for reading--and--well, I want to be alone.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I might have suggested nursing, even though it requires the
constant
use of the hands. But, of course, you'd never be alone.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Margot</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">No. I have no love for my fellow-creatures. I don't want to do
anything
for them.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Those are hard words, Fräulein Margot.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Margot</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I am hard. What have my fellow-creatures ever done for me?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And--your parents?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Margot</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">You refer to mamma? Mamma certainly means well. But mamma has
torn my
soul from my body. She has made use of the old principle of family
rule--which may have had some sense in the Stone Age--and has turned me
into a doll, a doll-creature that moves its eyes and says <i>ba</i> when you
press its head.--Just watch, Herr Ebeling!--Now haven't I a touching
fashion of casting up my eyes when I look at you in this simple,
thoughtful, innocent way?--And when I let the lids fall again in all
the bashful piety that I still can muster--isn't it simply sweet?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span> (<i>earnestly</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">My dear young girl, I really believe I must begin to say
&quot;stop&quot; now!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Margot</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Dear me! You're already disgusted with me! But if you had any
idea--do
you know what you'd think? &quot;Pity that I wasted such pains on a creature
like her!&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I should never think that, my dear child. I should only pity
you and
love you the more.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Margot</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I don't want to be pitied! And loved? (<i>Shakes her head.</i>)
At least not
that way--and not the other, either. That's still stupider. When I
listen to my friends--this one loves me, and that one loves me, and
this one kept my glove, and that one kissed my handkerchief--ugh! It
reminds me of the cackling of a lot of hens. Herr Ebeling, do you
believe criminals are scornful?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Why do you ask?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Margot</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Please answer.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">It's very often true of born criminals.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Margot</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Well, then, I've the criminal nature.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span> (<i>laughing against his will</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Tut, tut, my dear child, why so--all of a sudden?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Margot</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Because I inwardly shrug my shoulders at everything that goes
by the
name of Innocence. I keep thinking to myself, &quot;You silly sheep, what do
you know about it?&quot;--Ah, and yet, I envy them! At the balls, I see
everything as through a veil. The things that the men chatter about
sound far, far away--oceans off. I always feel like saying, &quot;Don't
trouble about me. Go to that girl over there. She's stupid enough.&quot; And
then--after I've come home--I weep, weep from sheer envy and utter
boredom, weep until I have to turn my pillow.--And mamma? Mamma drags
me from ball to ball: I mustn't be unlike the others, you know!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">My dear child, if this goes against your nature, why don't you
make
some resistance? Why don't you show your mother that you have thoughts
and feelings of your own which must be respected?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Margot</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Ah, my dear Herr Ebeling, just be a whipped dog yourself, year
in year
out! The dog doesn't resist either--but suddenly, some day--when he's
at the very end of his endurance--he bites his master's hand. I shall
bite soon!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, I'll grant you that your mother has probably made some
mistakes.
But only out of love, or because she knew no better. Just ask yourself
what would have become of you if you'd been left to yourself all this
time?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Margot</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I should have been embittered just the same--you're right--but
I should
not have let myself fall.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Who knows?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Margot</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Never! And I'll tell you something to prove it. Severely as I
have been
watched--and--surely there's nothing coquettish about me?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Certainly not.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Margot</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">You can believe me when I say that, in the general moral tone
prevailing over our society just now--and of which our mothers
naturally know nothing--there lurks a temptation which has over and
over again enticed even me. Such things are so personal, so secret--one
cannot describe them. Oh, I could have done whatever I wished! But
I said to myself: the first time, you were ignorant, you were
sacrificed--or, at least, you can talk it into yourself that you were
sacrificed--but if ever again--no, I can't say it after all!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I understand, my child.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Margot</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">If ever again--then you'll be lost--forever! Then there can be
no more
ideals, no more poetry--nothing lofty--nothing for which to work--and,
worst of all, nothing of which to dream. For to dream--ah, one must
dream, mustn't one? When one no longer has <i>that</i>!----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span> (<i>moved</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, dear child.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Margot</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">But you mustn't think that I'm trying to make myself
interesting, or
that I stand here before you beautifully whitened and purified! Oh, no!
What I'm going to say to you now has never been said to any one, to any
man before. And you are going to despise me utterly. But I must say
it--once, once in my life--and then the old hypocrisy can go on again.
Well, I don't know what it is, but it's like a fire in me. No, worse,
much worse! When I think of that frightful man, my heart fairly
shrivels up. And yet--I can never get away from it. There's always a
terror, a horror in me; and yet there is always an eternal--an eternal
hunger. Yes--a restlessness--a search--the whole day long. It's
strongest toward twilight. Then I want to go out--out into the wide
world--to fly to unknown lands. Then I think to myself--out there, no
one knows you; out there, there is no sin. Ah, it's as if I were
lashed! And I heap such reproaches upon myself because of it! Even now
you have not heard the worst. I must tell you the worst, too. Well, you
know how I hate that man--yet, sometimes it seems to me that I must go
to him and say to him--Behold, here I am again!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span> (<i>jumps up, muttering to
himself</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">What has he done? The scoundrel! The blackguard!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Margot</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">There! Now you know on whom you've wasted your sympathy! Now I
can go.
(<i>Stands up, snatches her muff, and prepares to leave.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">(<i>Who has been silently walking up and down more hotly.</i>)
It appears
then that you still love that man.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Margot</span> (<i>with a short, cutting laugh</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, Herr Ebeling, if you've gathered <i>that</i> from all I've
said, then I
might just as well have addressed myself to the four walls. I've been
hoping for three long years that you would secretly manage the thing in
such a way that I'd never have to see him again in all my life--never,
never--not even from a distance.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Why did you never confide in me before? Why to-day for the
first time?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Margot</span>.</p>

<p class="normal"><i>Can</i> one do such a thing? Is one ever allowed to? I'm a
well-bred
young girl, you know. I must observe the conventions. How I came to do
it to-day, I don't know myself. But formerly when you were alone with
me, did you ever, at any time, give me to understand, even by a glance,
that you--you knew anything--about me? Do you think such an attitude
gives one courage? Ah, and in my need I've prayed so often, &quot;Dear God,
let him see into my soul! If <i>he</i> doesn't free me, no one will.&quot;
Instead, you've only plunged me the deeper--pushed me before
you--always deeper into misery--into the arms of that beast--into the
filth. (<i>Sinks into a chair, sobbing.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">(<i>Regards her confusedly, then approaches her.</i>) Dear
child! That
wasn't my intention! (<i>Laying his hand on her shoulder caressingly.</i>)
My dear, dear child!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Margot</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">(<i>Grasps his hand, and presses her cheek to it. As he tries
to free it,
she holds it the more closely.</i>) Oh, don't leave me. I'm so lonely!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">My dear, dear child. (<i>He bends down to her and kisses her
on the brow.
She throws her arms about his neck and draws herself close to him. He
kisses her lips. She lets her head fall heavily upon his shoulder and
remains motionless while he caresses her gently. With a sudden impulse
she flings him from her, and sinks back in the chair.</i>) Margot, my
darling. Have I hurt you? Are you offended at what I did? If I've
misunderstood, if I have abused your confidence, I earnestly beg you to
forgive me.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Margot</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, I've so hungered--so hungered--for this--kiss!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span> (<i>turning eagerly toward her</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Margot!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Margot</span> (<i>warding him off</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">No! Go away! Go away!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">But you don't refuse me? And I'm not too old?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Margot</span> (<i>passionately bursting into
laughter</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Oh!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I was never free from the fear that you might not see anything
in me
except an image of that wasted, old creature. (<i>Instead of answering</i>,
<span class="sc2">Margot </span><i>stretches out her arms to him with a soft cry of longing</i>.
<span class="sc2">Ebeling </span><i>draws the low stool to the writing-chair on which she is

whole youth that I've squandered and frittered away comes back to me
once more through you. And now all will be well with you, too. It was
only a nightmare. Your true self had nothing to do with it. Only--you
must take heart again--you must think of yourself now.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Margot</span> (<i>ecstatically</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, I am equal to anything now. I am not afraid to face the
worst.
I can even marry that man. I shall send him my acceptance quite
calmly.--Of course. Why not?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span> (<i>shocked</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">What!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Margot</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Why should you be astonished at that? Now that I know you love
me? Only
for a year! Perhaps for two! Yes, two! Oh, please, two! Then, later,
when you've left me, let others come! It's all the same, who! For
marriage, of course, I'm entirely spoiled! But I'll be revenged on him!
On him and on Virtue and on Loyalty and on all that stuff with which
they've so long tormented me. And the evening before my wedding--then
may I--come to you again? Toward twilight! It must be on a Sunday. I'll
arrange for that, so we can be alone. Ah, I shall count the days till
then! Why do you look at me like that? (<span class="sc2">Ebeling </span><i>stands up and throws
himself on the sofa, burying his face in his hands. A long pause.</i>)
What can I have done? (<i>She stands up. Another pause.</i>) Surely I
haven't done you any wrong by loving you?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Go home now, my child.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Margot</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I wanted to leave some time ago, but you made me stay. (<i>She
buttons
her coat, throws on her boa, and is about to go out. Then she turns
around resolutely, and places herself before him.</i>) Oh, I know--I'm
disgraced--I'm not worthy of anything better--; but I needn't have had
to endure <i>such</i> scorn and contempt! (<span class="sc2">Ebeling </span><i>rises, looks at her,
groans, buries his face in his hands, and falls back into the chair</i>.
<span class="sc2">Margot </span><i>kneels beside him, weeping.</i>) Dear--dearest--what is it? What's
wrong, my darling?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span> (<i>compelling himself to be
composed</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Stand up! (<i>She does so.</i>) I am going to tell you. (<i>Stands
up
himself.</i>) I asked your mother's consent to my marrying you to-day.
There, now you know it. Good-bye. (<i>Sits down in the writing-chair. A
pause.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Margot</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">(<i>Does not move. Her face becomes hard and bitter.</i>) And
now that you
see what sort I am----H'm, yes. Ah, well, you'll soon console yourself.
There are so many others. Why should it be just I? Let me suggest one
of my friends--a dear--a pretty girl--with white teeth. Why take it to
heart? It hurts for the moment--but one easily forgets. Such girls as I
deserve nothing better. To them--one does this! (<i>Plucks the petals
from the roses which are standing before her in the vase.</i>) And then
one throws them away--like this! (<i>Throws the petals in his face.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span> (<i>brushing away the petals</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">What have the roses done to you, my child?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Margot</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I sent them to you. I, too, may destroy them.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span> (<i>springing up</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">It was you, you who all these years----?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Margot</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Good evening, Herr Ebeling. (<i>She goes out.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">(<i>Pauses for a moment irresolutely, struggling with himself,
then
hurries after her. His voice is heard.</i>) Stay here! Stay here! Come in
here! (<i>He reappears at the centre door, pulling her by the arm.</i>) Come
in here! Come back!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Margot</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">What do you want of me? I'll cry for help----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Come here! (<i>Drags her to the writing-table.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Margot</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Leave me alone!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Be quiet! Be quiet! (<i>Picks up one of the pictures standing
on the
table.</i>) There! That woman dragged my name in the gutter. Will you do
the same? Answer me! (<span class="sc2">Margot </span><i>stands motionless, the tears running down
her cheeks.</i>) Answer, I say.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Margot</span> (<i>slowly and heavily</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Ah, one thinks and says so much when there's no longer a
particle of
hope in one's life.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I understand. (<i>He throws the picture on the ground; frame
and glass
are dashed to pieces.</i>) Let us go to your parents. We'll arrange with
them what's best to be done. (<i>As she doesn't move.</i>) Well? (Margot
<i>shakes her head.</i>) You don't want to?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Margot</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Not that way! As I am now,
humiliated--mortified--disgraced--no, not
that way! I am so tired of playing Magdalen! No! When I come, I'll come
with a free step. I'll be able to look every man in the face! But I
must find out first what I am still worth, and (<i>looking him full in
the face</i>) it must be a great, great deal--to be worthy of you.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ebeling</span> (<i>moved</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Give me your hands, dear.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Margot</span> (<i>doing so</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">When we see each other again, they'll be red and ugly.

<h2>THE LAST VISIT</h2>
<br>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau Mulbridge</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Well, now we have seen our poor, dear captain for the last
time.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Mulbridge</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes. He was a good fellow, our captain and--awfully fond of
horses.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau Mulbridge</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Why, Daisy, what's the matter, dear? You've been standing here
all
alone, and yet, until now, you wouldn't stir from the coffin.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Daisy</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I saw him quite well from here, mother, dear.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Mulbridge</span> (<i>caressing her</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">My girlie--my little girl. Yes--we all loved him.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau Mulbridge</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">(<i>To </i><span class="sc2">Tempski</span>, <i>who is sobbing.</i>) There, there,
Tempski, hush now. (<i>A
bell rings, right.</i>) There's the bell; go and open the door. (<span class="sc2">Tempski </span>
<i>goes out at the right.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Mulbridge</span> (<i>to the </i><span class="sc2">Groom</span>).</p>

<p class="normal">And we'll be off to the stables!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau Mulbridge</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Sh! The Lieutenant!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Mulbridge</span> (<i>to the Groom</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Go on! (<i>Pushes the </i><span class="sc2">Groom </span><i>out, left.</i>)</p>

<p class="normal">(<span class="sc2">Lieutenant von Wolters </span><i>enters. He is an attractive young
officer,
very smart in appearance, wearing the uniform of an Uhlan</i>. <span class="sc2">Kellermann</span>,
<i>a self-possessed, sharp-eyed man, follows him. While they are
entering</i>, <span class="sc2">Tempski </span><i>comes in at the right, quietly places a wreath on
one of the piles near the columns, and goes out again.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Well, Herr-- (<i>He puts his hand to his eyes, overcome for
the moment,
then stiffly, trying to conceal his emotion.</i>) Herr--Kellermann was the
name, wasn't it?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Kellermann</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">At your service, Lieutenant.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">You have done everything very satisfactorily. I am much
obliged to you.
You understand that the removal of the coffin to the church is to be
accomplished as secretly as possible.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Kellermann</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I'm silent as the grave, Lieutenant. My business sort of
carries that
with it, don't you know.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">It will be dark about half past five. I have ordered the
troops that
are to accompany the casket to be here at half past six. At the
church--the catafalque and the rest--I can confidently leave all that
to you?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Kellermann</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Most assuredly, Lieutenant. I shall see that everything is of
the
finest.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">But remember your instructions: all superfluous ostentation is
to be
rigorously avoided--to-morrow at the funeral procession, also.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Kellermann</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I understand, Lieutenant--because of the way he met his death.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">The reason does not concern you. (<i>Turns to go.</i>)</p>

<p class="normal">Mulbridge.
Beg pardon, Lieutenant, but may I speak to you? I've been in the
captain's service seven years. I've been in Germany nearly eighteen
years--have a German wife and daughter. I'm not as young as I used to
be. What's going to become of the horses and the racing-stable, and--
the rest?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau Mulbridge</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, it's really too bad about him, Lieutenant. He's so fond
of his
horses. Why, if ever you want to speak to him, you have to go and stay
at the stable. That's the only way I can manage to see him.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Mulbridge</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And she's a great help to me, too, Lieutenant.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I can understand your anxiety, Mulbridge. The captain spoke
about you
on our last journey together. He especially commended you and your
family to my care. But, of course, everything will depend upon the
heir.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau Mulbridge</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And who is the heir, Lieutenant?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">No one knows. He had no relatives. But be assured that whoever
it is, I
will do my best to----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Mulbridge</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Thank you, Lieutenant! Thank you! (<i>He says a few words
aside to his
wife and goes out, left.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Have you anything else to do here, Herr Kellermann?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Kellermann</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, indeed, a great many things, Lieutenant. (<i>Goes out at
the centre,
carrying several wreaths, and then returns for more</i>. Frau Mulbridge
<i>helps him.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, by the way, may I have a word with you, Daisy? (<span class="sc2">Daisy </span><i>
comes
forward</i>, <span class="sc2">v. Wolters </span><i>continues aside to her.</i>) My dear child, I know
that the captain had a great deal of confidence in you.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Daisy</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, he had.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Well then, listen. Some one wishes to come here before the
casket is
removed some one who must not be seen.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Daisy</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Very well. She may.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span> (<i>amazed</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">What----? She----?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Daisy</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Why, it must be the lady.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">What lady?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Daisy</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">The lady for whom he let himself be shot.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">What! You know----?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Daisy</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">She had to come, of course. Who else should it be?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">H'm! Well then, listen carefully. If the undertaker--or any
other
stranger--should still be here when it begins to grow dark, throw on a
wrap and wait at the door downstairs until a carriage stops. Will you?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Daisy</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Certainly I will. And Tempski?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, Tempski, faithful as he is----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Daisy</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Tempski was never around in those days.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span> (<i>looking at her in
astonishment</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Oh--so Tempski--was never--around--in those days! H'm! Well
then, I'll
undertake to get rid of Tempski myself. Thank you, my child. (<i>Gives
her his hand, then aloud.</i>) I have another errand, but I'll be back
soon. (<i>Goes out at the right.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau Mulbridge</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">What did the lieutenant want of you?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Daisy</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Nothing in particular--something about the wreaths.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Kellermann</span> (<i>coming in from the back</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, with all those wreaths, we'll have to have an extra
carriage for
the flowers. He was a fine man, he was--a highly respected man! And on
horseback! Why, I've won every time I bet on him! Ah, yes, but sooner
or later they all have to come to me!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau Mulbridge</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And he was such a kind master! He was just like a child
sometimes--so
light-hearted and happy--like a little boy! Lately, to be sure,
he-- (<i>The bell rings.</i>) Well, Daisy!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Daisy</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">(<i>Who has stood without moving, lost in thought.</i>) I
guess Tempski will
go.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau Mulbridge</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, yes, you're right. Tempski is outside.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Tempski</span> (<i>brings in a wreath, sobbing</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">F-from--our--major.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau Mulbridge</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Why, Tempski, it's perfectly natural that the major----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Tempski</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">From--our--major.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau Mulbridge</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Take the wreath from him, Daisy.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Daisy</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, mother, dear. (<i>She does so</i>. <span class="sc2">Tempski </span><i>goes out,
crying.</i>)</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Kellermann</span> (<i>reaching for the wreath</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">From his major that must go on the coffin!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Daisy</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I'll do it.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Kellermann</span> (<i>in doubt</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Don't you think----?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau Mulbridge</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, let her; she looks after everything.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Kellermann</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">But nail it tightly, little lady--else it'll fall off when
they're
carrying him to the church.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Daisy</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, yes. (<i>Goes out back with the wreath. During the
following
conversation, the strokes of a hammer are heard.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau Mulbridge</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Everything is so well arranged here. I don't see why they've
got to
take him to the church.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Kellermann</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">The official statement is that it will prevent any
demonstration in the
street. You know, the town folks haven't taken very kindly to this
murdering business of late. But, of course, that's not the real reason.
The truth of the matter is that several very influential ladies would
like to attend the funeral without being seen. H'm!--love never dies,
they say. Ah, the captain was no saint, I can tell you!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau Mulbridge</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">What do you know about it?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Kellermann</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, well, there's a lot of talk about the veiled figures that
used to
go in and out of here at twilight. And if these mirrors could speak--!
That reminds me--I'd almost forgotten--we must cover the mirrors.
(<span class="sc2">Daisy </span><i>appears in front of the curtain. She is staring into space.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau Mulbridge</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">But since the casket is to be taken away in less than an
hour--what's
the use?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Kellermann</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">That doesn't make any difference. The mirrors have got to be
draped. It
would be a blemish on my art--and I wouldn't answer for it.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau Mulbridge</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Daisy!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Daisy</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, mother, dear.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau Mulbridge</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Go get a pair of lace curtains to hang over the mirrors.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Daisy</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, mother, dear. (<i>She does not stir.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau Mulbridge</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Daisy! You're not listening.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Daisy</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes I am, mother, dear. You asked me to-- (<i>Falters.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau Mulbridge</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I asked you to fetch a pair of lace curtains.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Daisy</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, mother, dear. (<i>Goes out, left.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau Mulbridge</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Now that the child isn't here--tell me, Herr Kellermann, do
you know
anything about the cause of the duel? We're all groping in the dark
here at the house.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Kellermann</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Well, they're saying all sorts of things. But the dead are my
friends.
I never say anything against them. It's a business principle with me.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau Mulbridge</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes--but the man who shot him, is he still walking around free
as air?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Kellermann</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, that's the way with these fine folks. They fall upon one
another
like highwaymen. Your honour or your life! The man who survives can
laugh. The man who falls--well, he falls into my arms. But, see here,
getting into a duel with that fellow, that Baron Renoir--why it was
nothing short of suicide! I tell you, where that man goes, no grass
grows! On the turf, at the card-table, with the women--always the same
story. That man shot him down like a rabbit. Oh, of course, it's
always a fine thing to lay down your life for a woman. That's a phrase
that----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau Mulbridge</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Do you really think that a woman----?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Kellermann</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Sh! Here comes your little girl. (<span class="sc2">Daisy </span><i>enters with two
vases, which
she is carrying very carefully.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau Mulbridge</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">What's that you're bringing?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Daisy</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I stopped and filled them first.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau Mulbridge</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">But you were to get a pair of lace curtains!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Daisy</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, forgive me, mother, dear. I thought you said vases. I'll
go (<i>Exit
with the vases.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau Mulbridge</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I don't know what's come over the child! Why, she's been such
a help
these days--thought of everything, wanted to do everything herself.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Kellermann</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">A nice little girl--how old is she?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau Mulbridge</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Seventeen, her last birthday.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Kellermann</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Is she at school?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau Mulbridge</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">She's been going to the Art Institute. She wants to teach
drawing.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Kellermann</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I suppose the captain thought a lot of her?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau Mulbridge</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, dear me, yes. She was always around him from the time that
she was
a mere child. They used to play together out in the yard like two
little kittens! Of course, when she grew older, that sort of thing
stopped. But lately, when he seemed so worried, I----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Kellermann</span>.</p>

<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau Mulbridge</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, indeed. I've had my suspicions for the last two months.
Well, when
he seemed so worried, I used to manage to send her in to him pretty
often. She read aloud to him--and so on. (<span class="sc2">Daisy </span><i>enters with a couple
of curtains, and a dark coat on her arm.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Kellermann</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Thanks, thanks, little lady. (<i>Takes the curtains from her
and stands
on a chair under one of the mirrors.</i>) What lovely Venetian lace! Ah,
yes, every mirror comes to this sooner or later!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Daisy</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I'd like to get a breath of fresh air, would you mind, mother,
dear? I
feel so----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau Mulbridge</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, yes, dear. Go out for a little while. (<span class="sc2">Daisy </span><i>puts on
her coat.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Kellermann</span> (<i>in front of the other mirror</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Why, here's a little bunch of flowers!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Daisy</span> (<i>eagerly</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, please, please, let me have it.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Kellermann</span> (<i>blowing off the dust</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">If it doesn't fall to pieces. (<i>Hands it to her.</i>) Ah,
yes, many, many
loved him! He had a beautiful life, he had a beautiful death, and, as
for a beautiful funeral--just leave that to Kellermann! (<i>Takes his
hat.</i>) I'll be back again for the procession. Good evening, ladies.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau Mulbridge</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Good evening. (<i>To </i><span class="sc2">Daisy</span>, <i>seeing her take off her
coat.</i>) I thought
you said you were going out?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Daisy</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, well, I've changed my mind now.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau Mulbridge</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I'm glad, because one feels so--so alone in here.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Daisy</span> (<i>with a glance backward</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">But we are not alone yet.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau Mulbridge</span> (<i>shuddering slightly</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">That's just it.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Daisy</span> (<i>staring straight before
her</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">I'm not afraid.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau Mulbridge</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Tell me something, Daisy, dear. Weren't you in there last
night?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Daisy</span> (<i>alarmed</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Last night? I?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau Mulbridge</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, at the coffin.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Daisy</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">What should I be doing at the coffin?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau Mulbridge</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Well, I thought I heard some one go past the door.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Daisy</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">You must have been dreaming, mother, dear.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau Mulbridge</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Very likely. I haven't been sleeping well these nights. See
here,
Daisy, perhaps he's left us something--you, at least--tell me, haven't
you been thinking about that sometimes?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Daisy</span> (<i>apart, with a glance at
the clock</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">If she doesn't come soon----!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau Mulbridge</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">What's that you were saying? (<i>The bell rings</i>. <span class="sc2">Daisy </span><i>
starts.</i>) Why,
what's the matter with you? (<span class="sc2">v. Wolters </span><i>enters.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span> (<i>calling</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Tempski!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Tempski</span> (<i>at the threshold, in military attitude</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Here, Lieutenant!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Hurry over to the garrison church and see if everything is
ready.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau Mulbridge</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Why, Kellermann will see----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And then go--or no--stay there until the casket arrives. Do
you
understand?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Tempski</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">At your command, Lieutenant. (<i>He goes out.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">That's attended to. And now, my dear Frau Mulbridge, there's
something
that I want to confide to you. A visitor is coming here presently--a
lady. (<span class="sc2">Frau Mulbridge </span><i>glances anxiously at </i><span class="sc2">Daisy</span>, <i>who nods.</i>) She
is
not to be seen by any one--except Daisy. Daisy, it appears, used to
open the door for her sometimes in former days.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau Mulbridge</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Daisy--? What does this mean?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Daisy</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, Tempski might have gossiped, you know.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau Mulbridge</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And so he let <i>you</i> open the door?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Daisy</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I never gossip, mother.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau Mulbridge</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I'm finding things out now! Why did I never hear of this
before?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Daisy</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, you were always in the stables with father in the evening.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau Mulbridge</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And there I was trying to keep this child from any knowledge
of the
things that went on in here--and he----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">We've no time for that now, Frau Mulbridge. Daisy, you will
watch
outside, won't you?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau Mulbridge</span> (<i>protesting</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, that's too----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Daisy</span> (<i>firmly</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, I'll watch. (<i>The bell rings softly.</i>) Should I----?
(<span class="sc2">v. Wolters </span><i>nods.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau Mulbridge</span> (<i>calling her back</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Daisy! (<span class="sc2">Daisy </span><i>goes out without noticing her mother.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">May I ask, Frau Mulbridge, that you----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau Mulbridge</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Very well. We have served him faithfully, and I'll not start
making any
trouble now at the end. (<i>Exit, left</i>. <span class="sc2">v. Wolters </span><i>goes to the door at
the right, listens, and then opens it cautiously</i>. <span class="sc2">The Unknown Lady </span>

the door</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">May I show you the way, Countess? (<span class="sc2">The Lady </span><i>shakes her head
and
motions questioningly toward the back</i>. <span class="sc2">v. Wolters </span><i>nods, and she goes
out through the curtained doorway. After a short pause</i>, <span class="sc2">v. Wolters </span>
<i>opens the door at the right.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span> (<i>calling</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Daisy! (<span class="sc2">Daisy </span><i>appears at the threshold.</i>) Kindly see
that no one
enters the house while this lady is here--no one, do you understand?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Daisy</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, yes, I understand very well.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">It may be that she has something else to say to me. If the men
should
come for the casket before she has left, take them around the other
way. Keep the main entrance clear.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Daisy</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">No, that wouldn't be safe.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Well, what shall we do?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Daisy</span> (<i>breathing heavily</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">I'll--think of something.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">His death grieves you, too, dear child?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Daisy</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Me? Oh, yes--me too. (<i>She goes out</i>. <span class="sc2">v. Wolters </span><i>walks
to and fro,

again walks to and fro, etc. At a slight movement of the curtain, he
stops, expectant</i>. <span class="sc2">The Lady</span>, <i>still veiled, comes forward slowly until
she has reached one of the chairs on the left. A pause.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Ah, Herr von Wolters--to let them close the coffin before I--I
had seen
him--I must confess, I had not expected that of you, Herr von Wolters.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I didn't dare prevent it, Countess--just because of your
coming. It was
the only way to have the house to ourselves.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Don't call me countess, Herr von Wolters. I am not a countess
here.
(<i>Glancing toward the door.</i>) I am only an unhappy woman whom no one in
this house knows, whom no one is to know.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Wouldn't you care to rest for a moment?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Are we quite safe here?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Quite. The little girl who, you say, is not unknown to you, is
outside
at the entrance. I have told her mother of your visit and she will not
enter the house. If you wish, however, we can lock the door.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, do. Or, no, perhaps it would be better not to--in case
any one----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Very well.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">(<i>Throws back her veil, revealing a very beautiful face,
which is
deathly pale and wears an expression of the deepest affliction. She
sinks into the chair. A pause.</i>) I wanted to lay my roses on his
breast. Ah, Herr von Wolters, I loved that man with an infinite love.
Perhaps grief will give my life a new and holier meaning--who knows? We
seek beauty--and find grief. Tell me, Herr von Wolters, you were his
best friend, did you never suspect----?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Never, never.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And when you received my letter early this morning asking you
to come
at once--not even then?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I could draw--various conclusions--from that.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">For instance----?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, please--really, you must excuse me----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">No, Herr von Wolters. We are here--but why don't you sit down?
(<i>He
does so.</i>) We are here together, you and I, to hold the last rites over
our sainted dead. His friend and his beloved who else has any right to
be here? Herr von Wolters, I have given you my full confidence--I have
made a strange confession to you. You will not betray me?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Ah!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And so, in this sacred hour, there must be no concealment
between us.
Answer me now. What does the world say?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span> (<i>embarrassed</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">The world says so many things, Countess.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Tell me, to what extent has my name been associated with this
affair?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I can't conceal the fact from you, Countess. Your name is
mentioned.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span> (<i>thoughtfully</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, that's what my husband says.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">But please let me add that not a shadow, not the slightest
suspicion,
has ever----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">But what else can they think?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">My dear Countess, when a woman is as beauti-- I mean, that
when a woman
is the centre of so much interest, it's not surprising that some notice
was taken of the attentions which he--</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span> (<i>somewhat impatiently</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Yes--but----?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">It naturally was observed that my friend----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Our friend had a--what shall I say--a susceptible heart. We
knew that,
who knew him so well. This was not the first time he had--been
interested in a woman. And that was why I arranged to have him seen in
our house as little as possible--lately, not at all.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">That fact did not escape notice, Countess. And as Baron Renoir
was
frequently seen with you--instead of----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span> (<i>somewhat excited</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Don't mention that name, Herr von Wolters! I can't stand it!
What could
have possessed that man Renoir--? But do tell me the rest. I've heard
only the merest details. They've only told me what they thought
necessary.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">No one knows what actually occurred between the two men. He
begged me
to ask no questions. You know, he was so reserved of late. It may
be that certain expressions which passed between them a few days
ago--after they had been drinking--had something to do with it--no one
knows. Perhaps there was some insult which was given in private--and
which neither of them would make public. The assurance that the injury,
whatever it may have been, was irreparable, must satisfy us.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, how I hate that man Renoir!--quite apart from the trouble
which he
has gotten me into! My husband warned me against him long ago. &quot;That
scoundrel will compromise you some day,&quot; he said, &quot;and then I'll have
to fight a duel with him.&quot; Instead--this! Oh, you poor, poor darling!
And now, when all was so quiet and peaceful between us!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">My dear Countess, if you think that the change which came over
him in
the last few months betokened peace and quiet----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span> (<i>nervously</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">I don't know anything about that! It wasn't my fault! Was I to
blame if
he insisted on having notions? Tell me one thing, Herr von Wolters, did
he die easily?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">No one dies easily, Countess.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Was he still living when they reached the house?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">No, he died on the field.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Do you know my first name, Herr von Wolters?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Certainly.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span> (<i>hesitating</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Did he--by any chance--speak--that name?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">That would have betrayed his secret, Countess.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I only meant--at the very last--when he was no
longer--conscious.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">No, Countess. But--pardon me, I don't want to be
indelicate--but did he
ever call you by some little--little term of endearment--some--
(<i>Stops, embarrassed.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Why do you ask?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">At the very end, he kept murmuring something that sounded like
&quot;Girlie&quot;--or----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span> (<i>indignantly</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">My dear Herr von Wolters, our intimacy was of a different
sort.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Pardon me, Countess, but you yourself asked. (<i>She nods. A
short
pause.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Good heavens--these curtains over the mirrors! They make me
feel as if
I were looking a blind man in the eyes!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Would you like to have me remove them?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">No, no. Never mind. I want to ask you something, Herr von
Wolters. Tell
me, what do you think of me?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span> (<i>confused</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">What do you mean, Countess?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I want to know what I have done that I should be doomed to
bring so
much sorrow into the lives of others. I had only just left school when
a strange young man shot himself under my window. It was on my account
that my husband was transferred here from his former garrison. Tell me,
what mark of Cain do I bear that all men follow me? I dress as simply
as I can. I never go out without a double veil. Sometimes I have
actually been tempted to throw vitriol in my face!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span> (<i>candidly</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, that would have been a shame, Countess!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span> (<i>severely</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Herr von Wolters!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, Countess, to mar that image of divinity would be a
sin--and I do
not hesitate to repeat it beside the coffin of my friend.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Don't! (<i>Reaches him her hand, which he kisses respectfully.</i>)
Dear me,
how strange it seems! Yesterday we scarcely knew one another--those few
visits at my house don't count. To-day--this short conversation--and
here we are, sitting side by side, the guardians of a secret which will
be buried forever with him. It will, Herr von Wolters?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Ah, my dear Countess, please do not offend me.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Very well, I shall not worry. Did you love him very dearly?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I thought a great deal of him, Countess. He took care of me
when I was
a young fellow quite alone in the world. He was so-- Really, I don't
know how I shall-- (<i>breaking down.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Courage, dear friend! We must both try to be brave.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span> (<i>firmly</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Thank you, Countess. You will not have to reprove me again.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">You evaded my question before. Do you consider me very guilty,
Herr von
Wolters?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">He loved you, Countess. That makes you holy in my eyes.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I thank you for that word--little as I deserve it. It has
never been my
way to undervalue myself. But your opinion meant so much to me----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span> (<i>puzzled</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">What difference could my humble opinion----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Don't say that, my dear friend. There are few people--perhaps
not even
my own husband--who have ever seen me as you see me at this moment--so
weak, so helpless, so--I had almost said--unguarded. Remember that--and
spare me.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I hope that I have not been inconsiderate, Countess.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">(<i>Putting her hand to her brow, stammering.</i>) No, no, no;
it's--it's
grieving for him that makes me lose my wits. The world had so long set
me on a pedestal that I thought I belonged there. Now I feel as if I
were torn down. Now I lie there-- Herr von Wolters, pay no attention to
me!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">If I could only help you, Countess!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span> (<i>smiling sorrowfully</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Help me--you? And yet, why not? His friend and his beloved! It
is we,
you and I, who are paying the last honours to the dead. Who could know
his worth better than we? Whose grief could be more eloquent than ours?
No, no, no--I must not talk. Ah, I see him before me now with his
bright, careless smile--his conqueror's smile! I suppose you never were
courted by women as he was?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">My dear Countess, I lead a fairly quiet, uneventful life.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">But you're not--you're not a Puritan, are you?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I must let others judge of that, Countess.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh! I should like to cry out my sorrow to the whole world--say
to them
all, &quot;You sordid souls, you couldn't know how much I loved him! What do
I care if you damn me, if you----&quot; (<i>The bell rings. She starts.</i>)
There's the bell!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span> (<i>reassuringly</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Probably just a wreath.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And if it's not--a----?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Why, Daisy is outside. But to make sure-- (<i>Listens at the
door, then
opens it cautiously.</i>) Daisy! (<span class="sc2">The Lady </span><i>drops her veil</i>. <span class="sc2">Daisy </span>
<i>appears at the threshold.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Daisy</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">What is it, Herr von Wolters?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Who rang?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Daisy</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">It was a wreath.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span> (<i>to </i><span class="sc2">The Lady</span>).</p>

<p class="normal">Just as I supposed.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span> (<i>to </i><span class="sc2">Daisy</span>).</p>

<p class="normal">Come here, dear. (<span class="sc2">Daisy </span><i>comes forward.</i>) You used to
open the door for
me, didn't you?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Daisy</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">But you don't know who I am?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Daisy</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">No.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">You'll not try to find out?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Daisy</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, no.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Was he fond of you?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Daisy</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, yes.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And have you been crying since he died?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Daisy</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">No.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">You're a pretty little girl.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Daisy</span> (<i>going</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Has my lady any more questions?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">(<i>Taking out a gold purse, to </i><span class="sc2">v. Wolters</span>.) Do you think
one might give
her anything? (<span class="sc2">v. Wolters </span><i>shakes his head.</i>) Thank you, dear. We shall
see each other again. (<i>As </i><span class="sc2">Daisy </span><i>lingers.</i>) What is it?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Daisy</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Very well--since I shall see my lady again. (<i>Goes out.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">It did seem though, as if she were waiting for something.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">If you will pardon me for the suggestion, it was surely
not--not for
money.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">By the way, this incident reminds me of something I was just
about
to-- Herr von Wolters, are you my friend?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">If you consider me worthy of that distinction, Countess.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Most assuredly. Well, Herr von Wolters, there is something
that
troubles me--something that desecrates my grief, if I may use the
word. There's the anxiety--the fear that-- Yes, yes--I must tell you
all. Herr von Wolters, he has my letters. Do you understand? (<i>He
nods.</i>) Didn't he give you something for me--a small, sealed package,
perhaps--nothing?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">You are forgetting, Countess, that I was ignorant of all this
until a
short time ago.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, that's true. H'm--it's really too bad. Who has the keys?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Why, he gave them to me just before the duel. I have them with
me.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">You've looked through the writing-table?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, I had to hand over his papers to the legal authorities. I
didn't
consider myself entitled to touch his private correspondence at
present.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Why not?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">He made a will the day before the duel.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Really? In whose favor?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I don't know.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">What! Didn't he make any allusion--nothing----?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">The only thing he said was that he had named me as executor.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">But he had no relatives. Who is to inherit his large fortune?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">As I've said, I don't know. However, he made a remark that I
didn't
quite understand, and that I--pardon me--would rather not repeat, if
you don't mind.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, please!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">It might give you pain, Countess.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span> (<i>sadly</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Nothing can give me pain after <i>this</i>.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Well, he said with a decided emphasis--though perhaps he did
not intend
that I should notice it--he said, &quot;The one who loved me best shall be
my heir.&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">What! He said that? Who could have loved him best if not I?
(<i>Terrified.</i>) For God's sake, Herr von Wolters!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Don't be alarmed, Countess. That would be too grotesque.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Perhaps this is his revenge.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Revenge? On you? What for?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">No, no--I'm quite out of my senses, I-- But, as you have the
keys, you
won't mind doing me this slight favour.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">What favour, Countess?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Search for the letters with me--now. It seems to me your duty,
not only
as a friend but as a gentleman.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Pardon me, my dear Countess, you were certainly his
last--perhaps his
only great love. But his life was varied--and if we were to open his
desk now--I really don't know what we might find there.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">You mean there would be letters from other----?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I must say no more.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Well, I'll shut my eyes. I'll only look for my own
handwriting.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">The will is to be opened in a few days, Countess. He has
doubtless
inserted a clause authorising me as executor to return certain papers
to their owners--or destroy them.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Ah, I see you're a Puritan, after all.--No, no, I'll not
trouble your
conscience. This loyalty which you bear him to the very grave is
so beautiful, so poetical, and I feel so near to you because of
it--(<i>Putting her hand over her eyes.</i>) Oh, those curtains in front of
the mirrors! They make me feel as if I were dead myself, (<span class="sc2">v. Wolters </span>
<i>is about to tear them down.</i>) No, no--don't. Thanks. Tell me, how long
will it be before the will is opened?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Unfortunately, the day is not yet appointed.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I shall not sleep a moment until then. Not even my love, my
grief, can
outweigh this terrible fear. My honour, my future, my life--everything
is at stake!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span> (<i>amazed</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Countess!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Please stop calling me Countess.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Forgive me. What should I----?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Call me your friend. I want to be that. From this day you
become closer
to me than any other being in all the world. Are you not the legacy, as
it were, that our dear dead has left me?--Ah, you and I must become
like brother and sister, two beings who have--nothing--to conceal from
one another. Herr von Wolters, will you be my guide, my confidant--my
friend?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Countess! My dear, dear Countess!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span> (<i>softly</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">But you're not to----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Forgive me. Your kindness to me makes me feel
so--confused--I----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Why should it? I feel certain that if he could see us at this
moment,
he himself would join our hands together.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Countess, if you ever need a man who would let himself be torn
to
pieces for you----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">No, not that. I only want you to take this great weight from
my soul.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Ah, Countess, I am a man of my word.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And that's what you call being torn to pieces for me?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span> (<i>trembling</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Whether I can answer for this to him and to my own
conscience--whether
I can ever again think of him--without shame--will depend upon what we
shall find in there.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">But you will open it? (<i>A pause.</i>) Herr von Wolters,
you'll not let me
die of fear and distraction?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I'll open it.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span> (<i>laying her hand on his
arm</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Thanks, thanks! Ah, you are good----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span> (<i>taking out the key</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Don't thank me. I feel as if he could hear it in there.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span> (<i>shuddering involuntarily</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">No--no! (<span class="sc2">v. Wolters </span><i>turns the key in the keyhole
unavailingly.</i>) Won't
it work?--Heavens, why your hand is trembling. Let me have it.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span> (<i>with a last attempt at
resistance</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">The keys were entrusted to <i>me</i>, Countess.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span> (<i>coaxingly</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, do let me have it. (<i>Sits at the writing-table and opens
the
drawer. With a low cry of surprise.</i>) Empty!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span> (<i>bending over her</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Empty?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Are you sure that this was----?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, that was the drawer in which he kept his private papers.
I'm sure
of it.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span> (<i>staring straight ahead</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Well, how can you explain----?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Perhaps he burned everything.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span> (<i>springing to her feet</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">And perhaps not!--Who knows?--This is the way he played with
the honour
of the woman who gave him all! This is my thanks! This is the action of
a gentleman!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">No gentleman, Countess, can do more than let himself be shot
for a
woman.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Who asked him to do it? Was it my fault if jealousy of Renoir
drove him
mad? And perhaps this is really his revenge! Perhaps we'll live to see
even more interesting disclosures!--This is my reward! This-- (<span class="sc2">Daisy </span>
<i>appears at the door in the centre.</i>) What do you want?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Daisy</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I beg your pardon. My lady is looking for--letters?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">So you've been in there eavesdropping, have you?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Daisy</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I brought in a wreath.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Well, what do you know about my letters?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Daisy</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Here they are. (<i>Takes a small package of letters from her
dress and
hands it to </i><span class="sc2">The Lady</span>.) I intended to give them to you <i>secretly</i> when
you left.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">(<i>Snatches the letters from her hand and looks at them.</i>)
How do you
happen to have these letters?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Daisy</span> (<i>wonderingly</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Why, how should I happen to have them? He gave them to me.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">To you? Who are you? Why to you?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Daisy</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Because he knew that I would do exactly what he told me to do.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span> (<i>to </i><span class="sc2">v. Wolters</span>).</p>

<p class="normal">Can you understand this?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span> (<i>gently</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">What did he tell you to do, Daisy?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Daisy</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">He said to me, &quot;These letters belong to the lady who used to
come to
see me sometimes. No one is to know about her--not even Herr von
Wolters.--When I am dead, the lady will----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Did he say that?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Daisy</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes. &quot;When I am dead, the lady will probably come here again.
If she
does, give her these letters. If she doesn't, then burn them with the
others.&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Wolters</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">What others?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Daisy</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Those over there in the stove.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span> (<i>examining the letters</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Look at this! Unsealed! Unwrapped!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Daisy</span> (<i>smiling</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">He knew that I wouldn't read them.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I suppose from now on I shall be at <i>your</i> mercy!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Daisy</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I don't know you, my lady. And even if I did, you need have no
fear.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span> (<i>to </i><span class="sc2">v. Wolters</span>).</p>

<p class="normal">Isn't she kind!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Daisy</span> (<i>always respectfully</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">But I should like to ask you a favour, my lady.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">By all means. What could I deny you, my dear?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Daisy</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">(<i>Goes into the room behind and returns with the flowers
that </i><span class="sc2">The Lady </span><i>had brought.</i>)
Oh please, please take these roses--away--with you.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">What does this mean?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Daisy</span> (<i>imploringly</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, please take them!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">What right have you to make such a shameless request of me?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Daisy</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I heard--forgive me, I didn't want to--I heard the way you
spoke about
him before. And it seems to me that your flowers no longer belong upon
his coffin.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">What do you say to that, Herr von Wolters? This person acts as
if she
were the mistress of the house!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Daisy</span> (<i>proudly</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">I am.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">(<i>Stares at her through her lorgnette and smiles.</i>) Oh,
really!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Daisy</span> (<i>her bearing pure and
proud</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">The night before he died I became--his wife. (<i>A long pause.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I hope you'll come and take tea with me in the near future,
Herr von
Wolters.</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">Pray, excuse me, but official duties will make it impossible

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Lady</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">(<i>Taken aback, but quickly recovering herself.</i>) Thank
you just the
same. (<i>A loud ring.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">v. Daisy</span> (<i>starts and looks at the
clock</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">There are the troops already.--Would you be so kind, Herr von
Wolters--? Please let no one come in here. (<span class="sc2">v. Wolters </span><i>bows and
hurries out at the right.</i>) May I take you out the back way, my lady?
No one will see you--or at least, only my mother. (<i>As the heavy steps
of the soldiers are heard, to herself, in suppressed agony.</i>) And
meanwhile--they will--take the coffin--away! (<i>Regaining possession of
herself.</i>) But wouldn't it be better to drop your veil? (<span class="sc2">The Lady </span><i>does
so.</i>) And your roses--do take them! (<span class="sc2">The Lady </span><i>snatches the roses from
her hand.</i>) This way, please. (<i>She opens the door at the left and goes

Germany.</i></p>

<br>
<h2>THE FAR-AWAY PRINCESS</h2>
<br>

<p class="normal"><i>The veranda of an inn. The right side of the stage and half
of the
background represent a framework of glass enclosing the veranda. The
left side and the other half of the background represent the stone
walls of the house. To the left, in the foreground, a door; another
door in the background, at the left. On the left, back, a buffet and
serving-table. Neat little tables and small iron chairs for visitors
are placed about the veranda. On the right, in the centre, a large
telescope, standing on a tripod, is directed through an open window</i>.
<span class="sc2">Rosa</span>, <i>dressed in the costume of the country, is arranging flowers on
the small tables</i>. <span class="sc2">Frau Lindemann</span>, <i>a handsome, stoutish woman in the
thirties, hurries in excitedly from the left</i>.
</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau Lindemann</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">There! Now she can come--curtains, bedding--everything fresh
and clean
as new! No, this honour, this unexpected honour--! Barons and counts
have been here often enough. Even the Russian princes sometimes come
up from the Springs. I don't bother my head about them--they're just
like--that!--But a princess--a real princess!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Rosa</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Perhaps it isn't a real princess after all.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau Lindemann</span> (<i>indignantly</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">What? What do you mean by that!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Rosa</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I was only thinking that a real princess wouldn't be coming to
an inn
like this. Real princesses won't lie on anything but silks and velvets.
You just wait and see; it's a trick!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau Lindemann</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Are you going to pretend that the letter isn't genuine;--that
the
letter is a forgery?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Rosa</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Maybe one of the regular customers is playing a joke. That
student,
Herr Strübel, he's always joking. (<i>Giggles.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau Lindemann</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">When Herr Strübel makes a joke, he makes a decent joke, a
real, genuine
joke. Oh, of course one has to pretend to be angry sometimes--but as
for writing a forged letter--My land!--a letter with a gold crown on
it--there! (<i>She takes a letter from her waist, and reads.</i>) &quot;This
afternoon, Her Highness, the Princess von Geldern, will stop at the
Fairview Inn, to rest an hour or so before making the descent to the
Springs. You are requested to have ready a quiet and comfortable room,
to guard Her Highness from any annoying advances, and, above all, to
maintain the strictest secrecy regarding this event, as otherwise the
royal visit will not be repeated. Baroness von Brook, maid of honour to
Her Highness.&quot; Now, what have you got to say?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Rosa</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Herr Strübel lent me a book once. A maid of honour came into
that, too.
I'm sure it's a trick!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau Lindemann</span> (<i>looking out toward
the back</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Dear, dear, isn't that Herr Strübel now, coming up the hill?
To-day of
all days! What on earth does he always want up here?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Rosa</span> (<i>pointedly</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">He's in such favour at the Inn.--He won't be leaving here all
day.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau Lindemann</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">That won't do at all. He's got to be sent off. If I only knew
how I
could--Oh, ho! I'll be disagreeable to him--that's the only way to
manage it!</p>

<p class="normal">(<span class="sc2">Strübel </span><i>enters. He is a handsome young fellow without much
polish,
but cheerful, unaffected, entirely at his ease, and invariably
good-natured.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Good day, everybody.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau Lindemann</span> (<i>sarcastically</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Charming day.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span> (<i>surprised at her coolness</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">I say! What's up? Who's been rubbing you the wrong way? May I
have a
glass of beer any way? Glass of beer, if you please!--Several glasses
of beer, if you please.--(<i>Sits down.</i>) Pestiferously hot this
afternoon.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau Lindemann</span> (<i>after a pause</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">H'm, H'm!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Landlady Linda, dear, why so quiet to-day?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau Lindemann</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">In the first place, Herr Strübel, I would have you know that
my name is
Frau Lindemann.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Just so.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau Lindemann</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And secondly, if you don't stop your familiarity----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">(<i>Singing, as </i><span class="sc2">Rosa </span><i>brings him a glass of beer.</i>)
&quot;Beer--beer!&quot;--Heavens and earth, how hot it is! (<i>Drinks.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau Lindemann</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">If you find it so hot, why don't you stay quietly down there
at the
Springs?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Ah, my soul thirsts for the heights--my soul thirsts for the
heights
every afternoon. Just as soon as ever my sallow-faced pupil has thrown
himself down on the couch to give his red corpuscles a chance to grow,
&quot;I gayly grasp my Alpine staff and mount to my beloved.&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau Lindemann</span> (<i>scornfully</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Bah!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, you're thinking that <i>you</i> are my beloved? No,
dearest: my beloved
stays down there. But to get nearer to her, I have to come up here--up
to your telescope. With the aid of your telescope I can look right into
her window--see?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Rosa</span> (<i>laughing</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, so that's why----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau Lindemann</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Perhaps you think I'm interested in all that?--Besides, I've
no more
time for you.--Moreover, I'm going to have this place cleaned right
away. Good-bye, Herr Strübel. (<i>Goes out.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span> (<i>laughing</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">I certainly caught it that time! See here, Rosa, what's got
into her
head?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Rosa</span> (<i>mysteriously</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Ahem, there are crowned heads and other
heads--and--ahem--there are
letters <i>with</i> crowns and letters <i>without</i> crowns.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Letters--? Are you----?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Rosa</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">There are maids of honour--and other maids! (<i>Giggles.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Permit me. (<i>Tapping her forehead lightly with his finger.</i>)
Ow! Ow!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Rosa</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">What's the matter?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Why, your head's on fire! Blow! Blow! And while you are
getting some
salve for my burns, I'll just-- (<i>Goes to the telescope.</i>)</p>

<p class="normal">(<i>Enter </i><span class="sc2">Frau Von Halldorf</span>,
<span class="sc2">Liddy</span>, <i>and </i><span class="sc2">Milly</span>. <span class="sc2">Frau
Von Halldorf </span><i>is
an aristocratic woman, somewhat supercilious and affected.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Liddy</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Here's the telescope, mother. Now you can see for yourself.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau v. Halldorf</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">What a pity that it's in use just now.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span> (<i>stepping back</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, I beg of you, ladies--I have plenty of time. I can wait.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau v. Halldorf</span> (<i>condescendingly</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Ah, thanks so much. (<i>She goes up to the telescope, while
Strübel
returns to his former place.</i>) Waitress! Bring us three glasses of
milk.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Liddy</span> (<i>as </i><span class="sc2">Milly </span><i>languidly
drops into a chair</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Beyond to the right is the road, mother.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau v. Halldorf</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, I have found the road, but I see no carriage--neither a
royal
carriage nor any other sort.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Liddy</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Let me look.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau v. Halldorf</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Please do.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Liddy</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">It has disappeared now.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau v. Halldorf</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Are you quite sure that it was a royal carriage?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Liddy</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, one has an instinct for that sort of thing, mother. It
comes to one
in the cradle.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau v. Halldorf</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">(<i>As </i><span class="sc2">Milly </span><i>yawns and sighs aloud.</i>) Are you
sleepy, dear?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Milly</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">No, only tired. I'm always tired.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau v. Halldorf</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Well, that's just why we are at the Springs. Do as the
princess does:
take the waters religiously.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Milly</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">The princess oughtn't to be climbing up such a steep hill
either on a
hot day like this.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau v. Halldorf</span> (<i>more softly</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Well, you know why we are taking all this trouble. If, by good
luck, we
should happen to meet the princess----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Liddy</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">(<i>Who has been looking through the telescope.</i>) Oh, there
it is again!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau v. Halldorf</span> (<i>eagerly</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Where? Where? (<i>Takes </i><span class="sc2">Liddy's </span><i>place.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Liddy</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">It's just coming around the turn at the top.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau v. Halldorf</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, now I see it! Why, there's no one inside!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Liddy</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Well, then she's coming up on foot.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau v. Halldorf</span> (<i>to </i><span class="sc2">Milly</span>).</p>

<p class="normal">See, the princess is coming up on foot, too. And she is just
as anæmic
as you are.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Milly</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">If I were going to marry a grand-duke, and if I could have my
own
carriage driven along beside me, I wouldn't complain of having to walk
either.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau v. Halldorf</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I can't see a thing now.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Liddy</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">You have to turn the screw, mother.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau v. Halldorf</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I have been turning it right along, but the telescope won't
move.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Liddy</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Let me try.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">(<i>Who has been throwing little wads of paper at </i><span class="sc2">Rosa </span><i>
during the
preceding conversation.</i>) What are they up to?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Liddy</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">It seems to me that you've turned the screw too far, mother.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau v. Halldorf</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Well, what shall we do about it?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span> (<i>rising</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Permit me to come to your aid, ladies. I've had some
experience with
these old screws.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau v. Halldorf</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Very kind indeed. (<span class="sc2">Strübel </span><i>busies himself with the
instrument.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Liddy</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Listen, mother. If the carriage has almost reached the top the
princess
can't be far off. Wouldn't it be best, then, to watch for them on the
road?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau v. Halldorf</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Certainly, if you think that would be best, dear Liddy.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">This is not only an old screw, but it's a regular perverted
old screw!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau v. Halldorf</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Ah, really?--(<i>Aside to her daughters.</i>) And if she
should actually
speak to us at this accidental meeting--and if we could present
ourselves as the subjects of her noble fiancé, and tell her that we
live at her future home--just imagine what an advantage that would give
us over the other women of the court!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">There, ladies! We have now rescued the useful instrument to
which the
far-sightedness of mankind is indebted.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau V. Halldorf</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Thanks, so much.--Pardon me, sir, but have you heard anything
about the
report that the princess is going to make the journey up here to-day?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">The princess? The Princess of the Springs? The Princess of the
lonely
villa? The Princess who is expected at the iron spring every morning,
but who has never been seen by a living soul? Why, I am enormously
interested. You wouldn't believe how much interested I am!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Liddy</span> (<i>who has looked out, back</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">There--there--there--it is!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau v. Halldorf</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">The carriage?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Liddy</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">It's reached the top already. It is stopping over there at the
edge of
the woods.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau v. Halldorf</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">She will surely enter it there, then. Come quickly, my dear
children,
so that it will look quite accidental.--Here is your money. (<i>She
throws a coin to </i><span class="sc2">Rosa </span><i>and unwraps a small package done up in tissue
paper which she has brought with her.</i>) Here is a bouquet for you and
here's one for you. You are to present these to the princess.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Milly</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">So that it will look quite accidental--oh, yes! (<i>All three
go out.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Good heavens! Could I--? I don't believe it! Surely she
sits--Well,
I'll make sure right away-- (<i>Goes up to the telescope and stops.</i>) Oh,
I'll go along with them, anyhow. (<i>Exit after them.</i>)</p>

<p class="normal">There--there--two ladies and a lackey are coming up the
footpath. Mercy
me! How my heart is beating!--If I had only had the sofa re-covered
last spring!--What am I going to say to them?--Rosa, don't you know a
poem by heart which you could speak to the princess? (<span class="sc2">Rosa </span><i>shrugs her

oneself with leaves, to watch the clouds pass by high above----</p>

<p class="normal">We can do that, too, sometime.</p>

<p class="normal">Sometime!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span> (<i>smiling and sighing</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, I command. (<i>They go out, left.</i>)</p>

<p class="normal">(<i>The stage remains empty for several moments. Then </i><span class="sc2">
Strübel </span><i>is heard
trying the latch of the back door.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel's Voice</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Hullo! What's up! Why is this locked all of a sudden?
Rosa!--Open up!
I've got to look through the telescope! Rosa! Won't you?--Oh, well,
I know how to help myself. (<i>He is seen walking outside of the
glass-covered veranda. Then he puts his head through the open window at
the right.</i>) Not a soul inside?-- (<i>Climbs over.</i>) Well, here we are.
What on earth has happened to these people? (<i>Unlocks the back door and
looks out.</i>) Everything deserted. Well, it's all the same to me.
(<i>Locks the door again.</i>) But let's find out right away what the
carriage has to do with the case. (<i>Prepares to look through the
telescope</i>. <span class="sc2">The Princess </span><i>enters cautiously through the door at the

<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">(<i>Startled at the sound of the key, turns around.</i>) Why,
how do you do?
(<span class="sc2">The Princess</span>, <i>not venturing to move, glances back at the door through

telescope a while? Please do. (<span class="sc2">The Princess</span>, <i>undecided as to whether

<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span> (<i>reassured</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, I'm not going away.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">That's right. But--where have you come from? The door was
locked.
Surely you didn't climb through the window as I did?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span> (<i>frightened</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">What?--You came--through the window?----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Of course I did.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span> (<i>frightened anew</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Then I had rather (<i>About to go back.</i>)</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, my dear young lady, you just stay right here. Why, before
I'd drive
you away I'd pitch myself headlong over a precipice!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span> (<i>smiling, reassured</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">I only wanted to go out into the woods for half an hour.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, then you're a regular guest here at the Inn?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span> (<i>quickly</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Yes--yes, of course.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And of course you drink the waters down below?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span> (<i>in a friendly way</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, yes, I drink the waters. And I'm taking the baths, too.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">
Two hundred metres up and down every time! Isn't that very hard on you?
Heavens! And you look so pale! See here, my dear young lady, don't you
do it. It would be better for you to go down there--that is-- Oh,
forgive me! I've been talking without thinking. Of course, you have
your own reasons-- It's decidedly cheaper up here. <i>I</i> know how to
value a thing of that sort. I've never had any money in all my life!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span> (<i>trying to seem
practical</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">But when one comes to a watering-place, one must have money.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span> (<i>slapping himself on the
chest</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Do I look to you as if I drank iron? Thank Heaven, I can't
afford such
luxuries! No; I'm only a poor fellow who earns his miserable pittance
during vacation by acting as a private tutor--that's to say,
&quot;miserable&quot; is only a figure of speech, for in the morning I lie abed
until nine, at noon I eat five, and at night seven, courses; and as for
work, I really haven't a thing to do! My pupil is so anæmic--why,
compared to him, <i>you're</i> fit for a circus rider!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span> (<i>laughing
unrestrainedly</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, well, I'm rather glad I'm not one.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Dear me, it's a business like any other.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Like any other? Really, I didn't think that.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And pray, what did you think then?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, I thought that they were--an entirely different sort of
people.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">My dear young lady, all people are &quot;an entirely different
sort.&quot; Of
course <i>we</i> two aren't. We get along real well together, don't we? As
poor as church mice, both of us!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span> (<i>smiling reflectively</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Who knows? Perhaps that's true.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span> (<i>kindly</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Do you know what? If you want to stay down there--I'll tell
you how one
can live cheaply. I have a friend, a student like myself. He's here to
mend up as you are. I feed him up at the house where I'm staying.
(<i>Frightened at a peculiar look of </i><span class="sc2">The Princess's</span>.) Oh, but you
mustn't be-- No, I shouldn't have said it. It wasn't decent of me.
Only, let me tell you, I'm so glad to be able to help the poor fellow
out of my unexpected earnings, that I'd like to be shouting it from the
housetops all the time! Of course, you understand that, don't you?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">You like to help people, then?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Surely--don't you?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span> (<i>reflecting</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">No. There's always so much talk about it, and the whole thing
immediately appears in the newspapers.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">What? If you help some one, that appears----?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span> (<i>quickly correcting
herself</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">I only mean if one takes part in entertainments for
charity----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, yes, naturally. In those things they always get some woman
of rank
to act as patroness, if they can, and she sees to it, you may be sure,
that the newspapers make a fuss over it.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span> (<i>demurely</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, not every----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Just try to teach me something I don't know about these titled
women!
Besides, my dear young lady, where is your home--in one of the large
cities, or----?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, no. In quite a small town--really more like the country.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Then, I'm going to show you something that you probably never
saw
before in all your life.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh do! What is it?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">A princess! H'm--not a make-believe, but a real, true-blue
princess!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, really?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes. Our Princess of the Springs.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And who may that be?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Why, Princess Marie Louise.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Of Geldern?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Of course.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Do you know her?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Why, certainly.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Really? I thought that she lived in great retirement.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Well, that doesn't do her any good. Not a bit of it. And
because you
are such a jolly, good fellow, I'm going to tell you my secret. I'm in
love with this princess!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">You can't imagine what a comfort it is. The fact is, every
young poet
has got to have a princess to love.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Are <i>you</i> a poet?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Can't you tell that by looking at me?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I never saw a poet before.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Never saw a poet--never saw a princess! Why, you're learning a
heap of
things to-day!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span> (<i>assenting</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">H'm--And have you written poems to her?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Why, that goes without saying! Quantities of 'em!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, please recite some little thing--won't you?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">No, not yet. Everything at the proper time.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Ah, yes, first I should like to see the princess.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">No, first I am going to tell you the whole story.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, yes, yes. Please do. (<i>Sits down.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Well, then--I had hardly heard that she was here before I was
dead in
love with her. It was just as quick as a shot, I tell you. Just as if I
had waited all my life long to fall in love with her. Besides, I also
heard about her beauty--and her sorrow. You see, she had an early love
affair.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span> (<i>disconcerted</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">What? Are they saying that?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes. It was a young officer who went to Africa because of
her--and died
there.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And they know that, too?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">What don't they know?--But that's a mere detail--it doesn't
concern
me. Even the fact that in six months she will become the bride of a
grand-duke--even that can make no difference to me. For the present she
is <i>my</i> princess.--But you're not listening to me!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, yes I am!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Do you know what that means--<i>my</i> princess? I'll not give
up <i>my</i>
princess--not for anything in all the world!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">But--if you don't even know her----?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I don't know her? Why, I know her as well as I know myself!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Have you ever met her, then?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I don't know of any one who has ever met her. And there's not
a soul
that can tell what she looks like. It is said that there were pictures
of her in the shop-windows when she first came, but they were removed
immediately. In the morning a great many people are always lurking
around the Springs trying to catch a glimpse of her. I myself have
gotten up at six o'clock a couple of times--on the same errand--and if
you knew me better, you'd realise what that meant. But not a sign of
her! Either she has the stuff brought to her house, or she has the
power of making herself invisible. (<span class="sc2">The Princess </span><i>turns aside to
conceal a smile.</i>) After that, I used to hang around her garden--every
day, for hours at a time. Until one day the policeman, whom the
managers of the Springs have stationed at the gates, came up to me and
asked me what on earth I was doing there. Well, that was the end of
those methods of approach! Suddenly, however, a happy thought struck
me. Now I can see her, and have her near to me as often as I wish.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Why, that's very interesting. How?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, that's just the point. H'm, should I risk it? Should I
take you
into my confidence?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">You promised me some time ago that you would show her to me.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Wait a second. (<i>Looks through the telescope.</i>) There she
is. Please
look for yourself.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">But I am-- (<i>She, too, looks through the telescope.</i>)
Actually, there
is the garden as plain as if one were in it.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And at the corner window on the left--with the
embroidery-frame--that's
she.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Are you absolutely certain that that is the princess?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Why, who else could it be?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, 'round about a princess like that--there are such a lot of
people.
For instance, there is her waiting-woman, there's the seamstress and
her assistants, there's----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">But my dear young lady, if you only understood anything about
these
matters, you would have been certain at the very first glance that it
was she--and no one else. Observe the nobility in every motion--the
queenly grace with which she bends over the embroidery-frame----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">How do you know that it's an embroidery-frame?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Why, what should a princess be bending over if not an
embroidery-frame?
Do you expect her to be darning stockings?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">It wouldn't hurt her at all!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Now, that's just one of those petty, bourgeois notions which
we ought
to suppress. It's not enough that we have to stick in this misery, but
we'd like to drag her down, too--that being far above all earthly
care----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, dear me!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">What are you sighing about so terribly?</p>

<p class="normal">The Princess</p>

<p class="normal">Tell me, wouldn't you like to have a closer acquaintance with
your
princess, sometime?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Closer? Why should I?--Isn't she close enough to me, my
far-away
princess?--for that's what I call her when I talk to myself about her.
And to have her <i>still</i> closer?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Why, so that you could talk to her and know what she really
was like.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span> (<i>terrified</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Talk to her! Heaven forbid! Goodness gracious, no! Just see
here--how
am I to face a princess? I'm an ordinary fellow, the son of poor folks.
I haven't polished manners--I haven't even a decent tailor. A lady like
that--why, she'd measure me from top to toe in one glance.--I've had my
lessons in the fine houses where I've applied as tutor. A glance from
boots to cravat--and you're dismissed!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And you think that I--(<i>correcting herself</i>)--that this
girl is as
superficial as that?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;This girl&quot;! Dear me, how that sounds! But, how should I ever
succeed
in showing her my real self? And even if I should, what would she
care?--Oh, yes, if she were like you--so nice and simple--and with such
a kindhearted, roguish little twinkle in her eye----!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Roguish--I? Why so?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Because you are laughing at me in your sleeve. And really I
deserve
nothing better.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">But your princess deserves something better than your opinion
of her.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">How do you know that?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">You really ought to try to become acquainted with her
sometime.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">No, no, no--and again no! As long as she remains my far-away
princess,
she is everything that I want her to be--modest, gracious, loving. She
smiles upon me dreamily. Yes, she even listens when I recite my poems
to her--and that can't be said of many people! And as soon as I have
finished, she sighs, takes a rose from her breast, and casts it down to
the poet.--I wrote a few verses yesterday about that rose, that flower
which represents the pinnacle of my desires, as it were.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span> (<i>eagerly</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, yes. Oh, please, please!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Well, then, here goes. H'm--&quot;Twenty roses nestling close----&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">What? Are there twenty now?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span> (<i>severely</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">My princess would not have interrupted me.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh please--forgive me.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I shall begin again.</p>
<div class="poem">

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">But you haven't even got it yet!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">That makes no difference in the end. I'm entirely independent
of such
externals. When some day I shall be explaining Ovid to the beginners,
or perhaps even reading Horace with the more advanced classes--no, it's
better for the present not to think of reaching any such dizzy heights
of greatness--well, then I shall always be saying to myself with a
smile of satisfaction, &quot;You, too, were one of those confounded artist
fellows--why, you once went so far as to love a princess!&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And that will make you happy?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Enormously!--For what makes us happy after all? A bit of
happiness?
Great heavens, no! Happiness wears out like an old glove.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Well, then, what does?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Ah, how should I know! Any kind of a dream--a fancy--a wish
unfulfilled--a sorrow that we coddle--some nothing which suddenly
becomes everything to us. I shall always say to my pupils--&quot;Young men,
if you want to be happy as long as you live, create gods for yourselves
in your own image; these gods will take care of your happiness.&quot;</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And what would the god be like that you would create?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal"><i>Would be? Is, my dear young lady, is!</i>--A man of the
world, a
gentleman, well bred, smiling, enjoying life--who looks out upon
mankind from under bushy eyebrows, who knows Nietzsche and Stendhal by
heart, and--(<i>pointing to his shoes</i>) who isn't down at the heels--a
god, in short, worthy of my princess. I know perfectly well that all my
life long I shall never do anything but crawl around on the ground like
an industrious ant, but I know, too, that the god of my fancy will
always take me by the collar when the proper moment comes and pull me
up again into the clouds. Yes, up there I'm safe.--And your god, or
rather your goddess--what would she look like?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span> (<i>thoughtfully</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">That's not easy to say. My goddess would be--a quiet, peaceful
woman
who would treasure a secret, little joy like the apple of her eye, who
would know nothing of the world except what she wanted to know, and who
would have the strength to make her own choice when it pleased her.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">But that doesn't seem to me a particularly lofty aspiration,
my dear
young lady.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Lofty as the heavens, my friend.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">My princess would be of a different opinion.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Do you think so?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">For that's merely the ideal of every little country girl.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Not her ideal--her daily life which she counts as naught. It
is my
ideal because I can never attain it.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh. I say, my dear young girl! It can't be as bad as that! A
young girl
like you--so charming and--I don't want to be forward, but if I could
only help you a bit!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Have you got to be helping all the time? Before, it was only a
cheap
lunch, now it's actually----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, yes, I'm an awful donkey, I know, but----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span> (<i>smiling</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Don't say any more about it, dear friend! I like you that way.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span> (<i>feeling oppressed by her
superiority</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Really you are an awfully strange person! There's something
about you
that--that--</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Well?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I can't exactly define it.--Tell me, weren't you wanting to go
into the
woods before? It's so--so oppressive in here.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oppressive? I don't find it so at all--quite the contrary.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">No, no--I'm restless. I don't know what--at all events, may I
not
escort you--? One can chat more freely, one can express himself more
openly--if one-- (<i>Takes a deep breath.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span> (<i>smiling</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">And you are leaving your far-away princess with such a light
heart?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span> (<i>carelessly</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, she! She won't run away. She'll be sitting there tomorrow
again--and the day after, too!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And so that is your great, undying love?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, but when a girl like you comes across one's path----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau v. Halldorf</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">(<i>Hurrying in and then drawing back in feigned astonishment.</i>)
Oh!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Liddy</span> and Milly (<i>similarly</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Oh!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Well, ladies, didn't I tell you that you wouldn't find her?
Princesses
don't grow along the roadside like weeds!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau v. Halldorf</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">(<i>Disregarding him ceremoniously.</i>) The infinite
happiness with which
this glorious event fills our hearts must excuse in some measure the
extraordinary breach of good manners which we are committing in daring
to address your Highness. But, as the fortunate subjects of your
Highness's most noble fiancé, we could not refrain from----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Well, well! What's all this?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau v. Halldorf</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">--from offering to our eagerly awaited sovereign a slight
token of our
future loyalty. Liddy! Milly! (<span class="sc2">Liddy </span><i>and </i><span class="sc2">Milly </span><i>come forward, and,
with low court bows, offer their bouquets.</i>) My daughters respectfully
present these few flowers to the illustrious princess----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I beg your pardon, but who is doing the joking here, you
or----?</p>

<p class="normal">(<span class="sc2">Frau v. Brook </span><i>enters</i>. <span class="sc2">The Princess</span>, <i>taken unawares,
has retreated
more and more helplessly toward the door at the left, undecided whether
to take flight or remain. She greets the arrival of </i><span class="sc2">Frau v. Brook </span>
<i>with a happy sigh of relief.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau v. Brook</span> (<i>severely</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Pardon me, ladies. Apparently you have not taken the proper
steps
toward being presented to Her Highness. In matters of this sort one
must first apply to me. I may be addressed every morning from eleven to
twelve, and I shall be happy to consider your desires.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau v. Halldorf</span> (<i>with dignity</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">I and my children, madame, were aware of the fact that we were
acting
contrary to the usual procedure; but the impulse of loyal hearts is
guided by no rule. I shall be glad to avail myself of your very kind
invitation.</p>
<br>
<p class="normal">(<i>All three go out with low curtsies to </i><span class="sc2">The Princess</span>.)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau v. Brook</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">What forwardness!--But how could you come down without
me?--And what is
that young man over there doing? Does he belong to those people?</p>

<p class="normal">(<span class="sc2">The Princess </span><i>shakes her head</i>. <span class="sc2">Strübel</span>, <i>without a
word, goes to get
his hat which has been lying on a chair, bows abruptly, and is about to
leave.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, no! That wouldn't be nice. Not that way----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau v. Brook</span> (<i>amazed</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">What?--What!--Why, your Highness----!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Let me be, Eugenie. This young man and I have become far too
good
friends to part in such an unfriendly, yes, almost hostile, fashion.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau v. Brook</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Your Highness, I am <i>very</i> much----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span> (<i>to </i><span class="sc2">Strübel</span>).</p>

<p class="normal">You and I will certainly remember this hour with great
pleasure, and I
thank you for it with all my heart. If I only had a rose with me so as
to give you your dear wish!--Eugenie, haven't we any roses with us?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau v. Brook</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Your Highness, I am <i>very</i> much----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">(<i>Examining herself and searching among the vases.</i>)
Well, how are we
going to manage it?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I most humbly thank--your Highness--for the kind intention.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">No, no--wait! (<i>Her glance falls upon the hat which she is
holding in
her hand with a sudden thought.</i>) I have it!--But don't think that I'm
joking.--And we'll have to do without scissors! (<i>She tears one of the
roses from the hat.</i>) I don't know whether there are just twenty
(<i>Holding out one of the roses to him.</i>) Well?--This rose has the
merit of being just as real as the sentiment of which we were speaking
before--and just as unfading.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Is this--to be--my punishment? (<span class="sc2">The Princess </span><i>smilingly
shakes her
head.</i>) Or does your Highness mean by it that only the Unreal never
fades?</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">That's exactly what I mean--because the Unreal must always
dwell in the
imagination.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">So that's it! Just as it is only the <i>far-away</i>
princesses who are
always near to us.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau v. Brook</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Permit me to remark, your Highness that it is <i>high</i> time----</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">As you see, those who are near must hurry away. (<i>Offering
him the rose
again.</i>) Well?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Strübel</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">(<i>Is about to take it, but lets his hand fall.</i>) With the
far-away
princess there--(<i>pointing down</i>) it would have been in harmony, but

thanks--I'd rather not. (<i>He bows and goes out.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Princess</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">(<i>Smiling pensively, throws away the artificial flower.</i>)
I'm going to
ask my fiancé to let me send him a rose.</p>

<p class="normal">Your Highness, I am <i>very</i> much--surprised!</p>
